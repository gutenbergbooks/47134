<h2>KAATERSKILL CONFERENCE<br />

JUNE 23-28, 1913</h2>


<h3>FIRST GENERAL SESSION<br />

(Monday evening, June 23)</h3>

<p>The PRESIDENT: The Thirty-fifth Annual
Conference of the American Library
Association begins this evening. Custom
has decreed that the presiding officer shall
deliver a message, and the present presiding
officer has not sufficient independence
of mind to depart from that long-established
custom.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS</h2>


<h3>The World of Print and the World's Work</h3>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Turning for a text to Victor Hugo's stirring
epic of Paris, these words may be
found in the section for May, and in the
third chapter thereof:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A Library implies an act of faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which generations still in darkness hid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sign in their night, in witness of the dawn.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When Johann Gutenberg in his secret
workshop poured the molten metal into
the rough matrices he had cut for separate
types, the instrument for the spread of
Democracy was created. When early Cavaliers
and Puritans planted the crude beginnings
of free public schools, the forces
of Democracy were multiplied. When half
a century ago the first meager beginnings
of the public library movement were
evolved, Democracy was for all time assured.
Thus have three great stages, separated
each by a span of two hundred
years from that preceding, marked that
world development whose ultimate meaning
is not equality of station or possession,
but equality of opportunity.</p>

<p>Not without stress and strife have these
yet fragmentary results been achieved.
Not without travail and difficulties will
universal acceptance be accorded in the
days to come. But no one may doubt the
final outcome which shall crown the struggle
of the centuries. The world was old
when typography was invented. Less than
five centuries have passed since then, and
in this interval&mdash;but a brief period in the
long history of human endeavor&mdash;there has
been more enlargement of opportunity for
the average man and woman than in all
the time that went before. Without the
instrumentality of the printed page, without
the reproductive processes that give to
all the world in myriad tongues the
thought of all the centuries, slavery, serfdom
and feudalism would still shackle the
millions not so fortunate as to be born to
purple and ermine, and fine linen.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The evolution of the book is therefore
the history of the unfoldment of human
rights. The chained tome in its medieval
prison cell has been supplanted by the
handy volume freely sent from the hospitable
public library to the homes of the
common people. The humblest citizen, today,
has at his command books in number
and in kind which royal treasuries could
not have purchased five hundred years
ago. In the sixteenth century, it took a
flock of sheep to furnish the vellum for one
edition of a book, and the product was for
the very few; in the twentieth, a forest
is felled to supply the paper for an edition,
and the output goes to many hundred
thousand readers. As books have multiplied,
learning has been more widely disseminated.
As more people have become
educated, the demand for books has increased
enormously. The multiplication of
books has stimulated the writing of them,
and the inevitable result has been a deterioration
of quality proportioned to the
increase in quantity. In the English language
alone, since 1880, 206,905 titles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
books printed in the United States, have
been listed, and 226,365 in Great Britain
since 1882. Of these 433,270 titles, 84,722
represent novels&mdash;36,607 issued in the
United States and 48,115 in Great Britain.
Despite the inclusion of the trivial and the
unsound in this vast mass of printed stuff,
no one can doubt the magnitude of the
service performed in the advancement of
human kind. The universities have felt
the touch of popular demand, and in this
country at least some of them have attempted
to respond. Through correspondence
courses, short courses, university
week conferences, summer schools, local
forums, traveling instructors, and other
media of extension, many institutions of
higher learning have given recognition to
the appeal of the masses. Logically with
this enlargement of educational opportunity,
the amplification of library facilities
has kept pace. The libraries have become
in a real sense the laboratory of learning.
Intended primarily as great storehouses
for the accumulation and preservation
rather than the use of manuscripts and
books, their doors have been opened wide
to all farers in search of truth or mental
stimulus.</p>

<p>In a report to the English King, Sir William
Berkeley wrote as governor of Virginia
in 1642: "I thank God there are no
free schools nor printing, and I hope we
shall not have them these hundred years;
for learning has brought disobedience into
the world, and printing has divulged them,
and libels against the best government.
God keep us from both."</p>

<p>Governor Berkeley's sentiments, expressed
by him in turgid rhetoric, were
held in his day by most men in authority,
but that did not prevent the planting of
little schoolhouses here and there, and
men of much vision and little property bequeathed
their possessions for maintaining
them. Many a school had its origin in a
bequest comprising a few milch kine, a
horse or two, or a crop of tobacco; in some
instances, slaves. From such beginnings,
with such endowments, was evolved three
hundred years ago the public system of
education which today prodigally promises,
though it but niggardly realizes, sixteen
years of schooling for every boy and
girl in the land.</p>

<p>If the span of years needed for the development
of the free library system has
been much shorter, the hostile attitude of
influential men and the privations that attended
pioneer efforts were no less
marked. As recently as 1889 the writer of
an article in the North American Review
labeled his attack: "Are public libraries
public blessings?" and answered his own
question in no uncertain negative. "Not
only have the public libraries, as a whole,
failed to reach their proper aim of giving
the means of education to the people," he
protested, "but they have gone aside from
their true path to furnish amusement and
that in part of a pernicious character,
chiefly to the young." And he added: "I
might have mentioned other possible dangers,
such as the power of the directors
of any library to make it a propaganda of
any delusive ism or doctrine subversive of
morality, society or government; but I prefer
to rest my case here."</p>

<p>And it was somewhat later than this
that the pages of the Century gave space
to correspondence in opposition to the
establishment of a public library system
for the city of New York.</p>

<p>These were but echoes of earlier antagonisms.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>For the documentary material dealing
with the beginnings of the public library
movement, the searcher must delve within
the thousand pages of a portly folio volume
issued by the British government sixty
years ago. If one possesses patience sufficient
to read the immense mass of dry
evidence compiled by a parliamentary
commission and "presented to both houses
of parliament by command of Her Majesty,"
some interesting facts in library history
will be found. A young man of twenty-three,
then an underling in the service
of the British Museum, afterwards an eminent
librarian, was one of the principal
witnesses. Edward Edwards had the gift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of vision. Half a century before public libraries
became the people's universities,
as they are today, his prophetic tongue
gave utterance to what has since become
the keynote of library aims and policies.
Badgered by hostile inquisitors, ridiculed
by press and politicians, he undeviatingly
clung to his views, and he lived to see his
prophecy realized.</p>

<p>Great libraries there had been before his
day; remarkable as a storehouse of knowledge
in printed form was, and is in our
own day, the institution with which he was
associated. But in these rich reference
collections intended for the student of research,
the element of popular use was
lacking. To have suggested the loan of a
single book for use outside the four walls
of the library would have startled and benumbed
everyone in authority&mdash;and without
authority&mdash;from the members of the
governing board to librarian, sub-librarians,
and messenger boys. This stripling
faced the members of parliament, and
without hesitation proclaimed his thesis.</p>

<p>"It is not merely to open the library to
persons who, from the engrossing nature
of their engagements of business, are at
present utterly excluded from it, but it is
also that the library may be made a direct
agent in some degree in the work of national
education. Let not anyone be
alarmed lest something very theoretical or
very revolutionary should be proposed. I
merely suggest that the library should be
opened to a class of men quite shut out
from it by its present regulations."</p>

<p>Then he added: "In such a country as
this there should be one great national
storehouse. But in addition to this, there
should be libraries in different quarters on
a humbler scale, very freely accessible."</p>

<p>One of the ablest members of parliament,
William Ewart, of Liverpool, became
intensely interested in the views expressed
by young Edwards, and from that
day was counted the consistent champion
of library privileges for the common people.
Largely through his instrumentality,
aided by such men as Richard Cobden,
John Bright and Joseph Brotherton, parliament
passed an act "for the encouragement
of museums." Out of this measure
grew the later public libraries' act. This
notable step was not accomplished without
bitter opposition.</p>

<p>"The next thing we will be asked to do,"
said one indignant member on the floor of
the House, "is to furnish people with
quoits and peg-tops and footballs at the expense
of taxpayers. Soon we will be thinking
of introducing the performances of
Punch for the amusement of the people."</p>

<p>Events in England influenced similar
movements in the United States. In a letter
to Edward Everett, in 1851, Mr. George
Ticknor gave the first impetus to the establishment
of a free public library in Boston&mdash;the
first in the new world to be maintained
permanently by the people for the
people.</p>

<p>"I would establish a library which differs
from all free libraries yet attempted," he
wrote. "I mean one in which any popular
books, tending to moral and intellectual
improvement, shall be furnished in such
numbers of copies that many persons can
be reading the same book at the same
time; in short, that not only the best books
of all sorts, but the pleasant literature of
the day, shall be made accessible to the
whole people when they most care for it;
that is, when it is new and fresh."</p>

<p>Sixty years after the date of Mr. Ticknor's
letter, and chiefly within the last two
decades of the period, the public library
movement has assumed a place in public
education, which, relatively, the public
school movement attained only after three
hundred years of effort. When Thomas
Bodley died, in 1613, in all Europe there
were but three libraries accessible to the
public&mdash;the Bodleian, the Angelo Rocca at
Rome and the Ambrosian at Milan. In
1841 the Penny Cyclopedia devoted about
four inches of a narrow column to the subject
of libraries, ancient and modern, and
limited its reference to American libraries
to one sentence, obtained at second hand
from an older contemporary:</p>

<p>"In the United States of America, according
to the Encyclopedia Americana,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the principal libraries are, or were in 1831,
that of Harvard College, containing 36,000
volumes; the Philadelphia Library, containing
27,000; that of the Boston Athenaeum,
containing 26,000; that of Congress,
containing 16,000, and that of
Charleston, containing 13,000."</p>

<p>It is only since 1867 that the federal government
has deemed it worth while to
compile library statistics, and the first
comprehensive figures were gathered in
1875. It is worth noting that then they
embraced all libraries comprising 300 volumes,
and that in 1893 no mention is made
of collections containing less than a thousand
volumes, while the most recent official
enumeration makes 5,000 volumes the
unit of consideration. From these official
figures may be gleaned something of the
extraordinary growth of libraries, both numerically
and in size. In 1875, including
school libraries there were 2,039 containing
a thousand volumes, ten years later
there were 4,026, ten years after that 8,000,
and at this date there are in this class not
less than 12,000, while the recorded number
comprising three hundred volumes or
more reaches the substantial total of 15,634,
and 2,298 of these catalog in excess of
5,000 volumes each.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>These figures show phenomenal growth,
but even more impressive are the facts
that give their full meaning in detail.
From a striking compilation issued in Germany
by Die Br&uuml;cke a few weeks ago, together
with figures extracted by means of
a questionnaire, supplemented by statistical
material gathered by the Bureau of
Education, the facts which follow have
been deduced: Counting the great libraries
of the world, the six continents abutting
the seven seas possess 324 libraries
whose book collections number in excess
of 100,000 volumes each, and of these 79&mdash;or
approximately one-fourth&mdash;are located
in the Americas. Of the 79 American libraries
72 are in the United States, including
university, public, governmental and
miscellaneous institutions, with a combined
collection of 19,295,000 volumes. If
this statistical inquiry is pursued further,
a reason becomes apparent why millions
are starved for want of books while other
millions seemingly have a surfeit of them.
The rural regions, save in a handful of
commonwealths whose library commissions
or state libraries actively administer
traveling libraries, the book supply is practically
negligible. Even the hundreds of
itinerating libraries but meagerly meet the
want. All the traveling libraries in all the
United States have a total issue annually
less than that of any one of twenty municipal
systems that can be named. The
public library facilities in at least six thousand
of the smaller towns are pitifully insufficient
and in hundreds of them wholly
absent. The movement to supply books
to the people was first launched in the
rural regions seventy years ago. Indeed
the movement for popular education
known as the American Lyceum, which
forecast the activities of the modern public
library just as the mechanics' institutes
of Great Britain prepared the soil for them
in that country, flourished chiefly in the
less thickly settled centers of population.
The early district school libraries melted
away in New York state and Wisconsin
and other states, and the devastated
shelves have never been amply renewed.
The library commissions are valiantly and
energetically endeavoring to supply the
want, but their efforts are all too feebly
supported by their respective states. In
this particular, the policy is that which
unfortunately obtains as to all educational
effort. More than 55 per cent of the young
people from 6 to 20 years old&mdash;about 17,000,000
of them&mdash;live in the country or in
towns of less than two thousand inhabitants.
According to an official report from
which this statement is extracted, there
are 5,000 country schools still taught in
primitive log houses, uncomfortable, unsuitable,
unventilated, unsanitary, illy equipped,
poorly lighted, imperfectly heated&mdash;boys
and girls in all stages of advancement
receiving instruction from one teacher
of very low grade. It is plain why, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the summing up of this report, "illiteracy
in rural territory is twice as great as in
urban territory, notwithstanding that thousands
of illiterate immigrants are crowded
in the great manufacturing and industrial
centers. The illiteracy among native-born
children of native parentage is more than
three times as great as among native children
of foreign parentage, largely on account
of the lack of opportunities for education
in rural America." In Indian legend
Nokomis, the earth, symbolizes the
strength of motherhood; it may yet chance
that the classic myth of the hero who
gained his strength because he kissed the
earth may be fully understood in America
only when the people learn that they will
remain strong, as Mr. M&uuml;nsterberg has
put it, "only by returning with every generation
to the soil."</p>

<p>If the states have proved recreant to
duty in this particular, the municipalities
have shown an increasing conception of
educational values. The figures make an
imposing statistical array. In the United
States there are 1,222 incorporated places
of 5,000 or more inhabitants, and their libraries
house 90,000,000 volumes, with a total
yearly use aggregating 110,000,000 issues.
Four million volumes a year are
added to their shelves, and collectively
they derive an income of $20,000,000. Their
permanent endowments, which it must be
regretfully said but 600 of them share, now
aggregate $40,000,000. Nearly all of these
libraries occupy buildings of their own,
Mr. Andrew Carnegie having supplied approximately
$42,226,338 for the purpose in
the United States, and the balance of the
$100,000,000 represented in buildings having
been donated by local benefactors or
raised by taxation.</p>

<p>The population of these 1,222 places is
38,758,584, considerably less than half that
of the entire United States. Their book
possessions, on the other hand, are nine
times as great as those in the rest of the
country; the circulation of the books nearly
twelve times in volume. Closer analysis
of these figures enforces still more
strongly the actual concentration of the
available book supply. The hundred largest
cities of the United States, varying in
size from a minimum of 53,684 to a maximum
of 4,766,883, possess in the aggregate
more books than all the rest of the country
together, and represent the bulk of the
trained professional service rendered. The
great majority of the 3,000 graduates
whom the library schools have sent into
service since the first class was organized
in 1887, are in these libraries and in the
university libraries. Forty per cent of the
books circulated are issued to the dwellers
in these one hundred cities, and in fifteen
of them the stupendous total of 30,000,834
issues for home reading was recorded last
year. Without such analysis as this, the
statistical totals would be misleading. The
concentration of resources and of trained
service in large centers of population, comparatively
few in number, makes evident
the underlying cause for the modern trend
of library development. A further study of
conditions in these human hives justifies
the specialized forms of service which
have become a marked factor in library
extension within a decade. With increased
resources, with vastly improved internal
machinery, with enlarged conception of opportunity
for useful service, have come
greater liberality of rules and ever widening
circles of activity, until today no individual
and no group of individuals, remains
outside the radius of library influence. If
this awakened zeal has spurred to efforts
that seem outside the legitimate sphere of
library work, no undue concern need be
felt. Neither the genius or enthusiasm of
the individual nor the enterprise of a
group of individuals will ever be permitted
to go too rapidly or too far: the world's
natural conservatism and inherited unbelief
stand ever ready to retard or prevent.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Specialization has been incorporated
into library administration chiefly to give
expeditious and thorough aid to seekers of
information touching a wide variety of interests&mdash;business
men, legislators, craftsmen,
special investigators and students of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
every sort. This added duty has not diminished
its initial function to make available
the literature of all time, nor to satisfy
those who go to books for the pure
joy of reading. The recreative service of
the library is as important as the educative,
or the informative. For the great
mass of people, the problem has been the
problem of toil long and uninterrupted.
The successful struggle of the unions to
restrict the hours of labor has developed
another problem almost as serious&mdash;the
problem of leisure. Interwoven with this
acute problem is another which subdivision
of labor has introduced into modern
industrial occupations&mdash;the terrible fatigue
which results from a monotonous repetition
of the same process hour after hour,
day after day, week after week. Such
blind concentration in the making of but
one piece of a machine, or a garment, or
a watch, or any other article of merchandise,
without knowledge of its relationship
to the rest, soon wears the human worker
out. There must be an outlet of play, of
fun, or recreation. The librarian need not
feel apologetic to the public because perchance
his circulation statistics show that
70 per cent of it is classed as fiction. If
he wishes to reduce this percentage to 69
or 68 or 61, let him do it not by discouraging
the reading of novels, but by stimulating
the use of books in other classes of
literature. But well does he merit his own
sense of humiliation and the condemnation
of the critics if he needs must feel
ashamed of the kind of novels that he puts
upon his shelves. To quote a fellow librarian
who expresses admirably the value
of such literature, "A good story has created
many an oasis in many an otherwise
arid life. Many-sidedness of interest
makes for good morals, and millions of our
fellows step through the pages of a story
book into a broader world than their nature
and their circumstances ever permit
them to visit. If anything is to stay the
narrowing and hardening process which
specialization of learning, specialization of
inquiry and of industry and swift accumulation
of wealth are setting up among us,
it is a return to romance, poetry, imagination,
fancy, and the general culture we are
now taught to despise. Of all these the
novel is a part; rather, in the novel are all
of these. But a race may surely find
springing up in itself a fresh love of romance,
in the high sense of that word,
which can keep it active, hopeful, ardent,
progressive. Perhaps the novel is to be,
in the next decades, part of the outward
manifestation of a new birth of this love
of breadth and happiness."</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Many of the factory workers are young
men and young women, whose starved
imaginations seek an outlet that will not
be denied. In lieu of wholesome recreation
and material, they will find "clues to life's
perplexities" in salacious plays, in cheap
vaudeville performances, in the suggestive
pages of railway literature, in other ways
that make for a lowering of moral tone.
The reaction that craves amusement of
any sort is manifest in the nightly crowded
stalls of the cheap theaters. Eight million
spectators view every moving picture film
that is manufactured. It is estimated that
one-sixth of the entire population of New
York City and of Chicago attends the theaters
on any Sunday of the year. One
Sunday evening, at the instance of Miss
Jane Addams, an investigation was made
of 466 theaters in the latter city, and it
was discovered that in the majority of
them the leading theme was revenge; the
lover following his rival; the outraged husband
seeking his wife's betrayer; or the
wiping out by death of a blot on a hitherto
unstained honor. And of course these
influences extend to the children who are
always the most ardent and responsive of
audiences. There is grave danger that the
race will develop a ragtime disposition, a
moving picture habit and a comic supplement
mind.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>It is perhaps too early to point to the
specialized attention which libraries have
given to the needs of young people as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
a distinct contribution to society. Another
generation must come before material evidence
for good or ill becomes apparent.
That the work is well worth the thought bestowed,
whether present methods survive
or are modified, may not be gainsaid. The
derelicts of humanity are the wrecks who
knew no guiding light. The reformatories
and the workhouses, the penal institutions
generally and the charitable ones principally,
are not merely a burden upon society,
but a reproach for duty unperformed.
Society is at last beginning to realize that
it is better to perfect machinery of production
than to mend the imperfect product;
that to dispense charity may ameliorate
individual suffering, but does not prevent
recurrence. And so more attention is
being given prevention than cure.</p>

<p>If numbers and social and industrial importance
warrant special library facilities
for children, certainly the same reasons
underlie the special library work with foreigners
which has within recent years
been carried on extensively in the larger
cities. Last month the census bureau issued
an abstract of startling import to
those who view in the coming of vast numbers
from across the waters a menace to
the institutions of this democracy. According
to this official enumeration, in but
fourteen of fifty cities having over 100,000
inhabitants in 1910 did native whites of
native parentage contribute as much as
one-half the total population. The proportion
exceeded three-fifths in only four cities.
On the other hand, in twenty-two
cities of this class, of which fifteen are in
New England and the Middle Atlantic divisions,
less than one-third of the population
were native whites of native parentage,
over two-thirds in all but one of these
cities consisting of foreign-born whites
and their children.</p>

<p>In his Ode delivered at Harvard, Lowell
eloquently referred to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The pith and marrow of a Nation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawing force from all her men,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For her time of need, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pulsing it again through them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She that lifts up the manhood of the poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She of the open soul and open door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With room about her hearth for all mankind!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was written in 1865. Since then the
rim of the Mediterranean has sent its enormous
contribution of unskilled and unlettered
human beings to the New World.
There have been three great tides of migration
from over-seas. The first came to
secure liberty of conscience; the second
sought liberty of political thought and action;
the third came in quest of bread.
And of the three, incomparably the greater
problem of assimilation is that presented
by the last comers. Inextricably interwoven
are all the complexities which face the
great and growing municipalities, politically
and industrially and socially. These are
the awful problems of congestion and festering
slums, of corruption in public life,
of the exploitation of womanhood, of terrible
struggle with wretchedness and poverty.
Rightly directed, the native qualities
and strength of these peoples will bring a
splendid contribution in the making of a
virile citizenship. Wrongly shaped, their
course in the life of the city may readily
become of sinister import. Frequently they
are misunderstood, and they easily misunderstand.
The problem is one of education,
but it is that most difficult problem,
of education for grown-ups. Here
perhaps the library may render the most
distinct service, in that it can bring to
them in their own tongues the ideals and
the underlying principles of life and custom
in their adopted country; and through
their children, as they swarm into the
children's rooms, is established a point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
contact which no other agency could so
effectually provide.</p>

<p>Under the repressive measures of old-world
governments, the racial culture and
national spirit of Poles, Lithuanians,
Finns, Balkan Slavs, and Russian Jews
have been stunted. Here both are warmed
into life and renewed vigor, and in generous
measure are given back to the land
of their adoption. Such racial contribution
must prove of enormous value, whether,
as many sociologists believe, this country
is to prove a great melting pot for the fusing
of many races, or whether as Dr. Zhitlowsky
contends, there is to be one country,
one set of laws, one speech, but a vast
variety of national cultures, contributing
each its due share to the enrichment of the
common stock.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Great changes have come about in the
methods that obtain for the exercise of
popular government. In a Democracy
whose chief strength is derived from an
intelligent public opinion, the sharpening
of such intelligence and enlargement of
general knowledge concerning affairs of
common concern are of paramount importance.
Statute books are heavily cumbered
with laws that are unenforced because
public opinion goes counter to them.
Nonenforcement breeds disrespect for law,
and unscientific making of laws leads to
their disregard. So the earliest attempts
to find a remedy contemplated merely the
legislator and the official, bringing together
for their use through the combined services
of trained economists and of expert
reference librarians the principles and
foundation for contemplated legislation
and the data as to similar attempts elsewhere.
Fruitful as this service has proved
within the limitation of state and municipal
officialdom, a broadened conception of
possibilities now enlarges the scope of the
work to include citizen organizations interested
in the study of public questions,
students of sociology, economics and political
science, business men keenly alive
to the intimate association&mdash;in a legitimate
sense&mdash;of business and politics, and
that new and powerful element in public
affairs which has added three million
voters to the poll lists in ten states, and
will soon add eleven million voters more
in the remaining thirty-eight. The new
library service centering in state and municipal
legislative reference libraries, and
in Civics departments of large public libraries,
forecasts the era, now rapidly approaching,
when aldermen and state representatives
will still enact laws and state
and city officials will enforce them, but
their making will be determined strictly by
public opinion. The local government of
the future will be by quasi-public citizen
organizations directing aldermen and state
legislators accurately to register their will.
When representative government becomes
misrepresentative, in the words of a modern
humorist, Democracy will ask the Powers
that Be whether they are the Powers
that Ought to Be. To intelligently determine
the answer, public opinion must not
ignorantly ask.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>This has been called the age of utilitarianism.
Such it unquestionably is, but
its practicality is not disassociated from
idealism. The resources of numberless
commercial enterprises are each in this
day reckoned in millions, and their products
are figured in terms of many millions
more, as once thousands represented the
spread of even the greatest of industries.
But more and more, business men are coming
to realize that business organization
as it affects for weal or woe thousands who
contribute to their success, must be conducted
as a trust for the common good,
and not merely for selfish exploitation, or
for oppression. As the trade guilds of old
wielded their vast power for common ends,
so all the workers gave the best at their
command to make their articles of merchandise
the most perfect that human skill
and care could produce. Men of business
whose executive skill determines the destiny
of thousands in their employ, are
growing more and more to an appreciation
of the trusteeship that is theirs. A humane
spirit is entering the relationship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
between employer and employed. Great
commercial organizations are conducting
elaborate investigations into conditions of
housing, sanitation, prolongation of school
life, social insurance and similar subjects
of betterment for the toilers; but a brief
span ago they were concerned chiefly with
trade extension and lowering of wages, all
unconcerned about the living conditions of
their dependents. They too are now exemplifying
the possession of that constructive
imagination which builds large and
beyond the present. For results that grow
out of experience and of experiment they
also are in part dependent upon the sifted
facts that are found in print. The business
house library is a recent development,
and in ministering in different ways to
both employer and employed, gives promise
of widespread usefulness.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>With the tremendous recent growth of
industrialism and the rapid multiplication
of invention, the manifest need for making
available the vast sum of gathered knowledge
concerning the discoveries of modern
science has evolved the great special libraries
devoted to the varied subdivisions
of the subject. Munificently endowed as
many of them are, highly organized for
ready access to material, administered to
encourage use and to give expert aid as
well, their great importance cannot be overestimated.
What they accomplish is not
wholly reducible to statistics, nor can their
influence be readily traced, perhaps, to the
great undertakings of today which overshadow
the seven wonders of antiquity.
But there can be no question that without
the opportunities that here lie for study
and research, and&mdash;no less important&mdash;without
the skilled assistance freely rendered
by librarian and bibliographer, special
talent would often remain dormant
and its possessor unsatisfied. Greater
here would be the loss to society than to
the individual.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Thus the libraries are endeavoring to
make themselves useful in every field of
human enterprise or interest; with books
of facts for the information they possess;
with books of inspiration for the stimulus
they give and the power they generate.
Conjointly these yield the equipment
which develops the constructive imagination,
without which the world would seem
but a sorry and a shriveled spot to dwell
upon. The poet and the dreamer conceive
the great things which are wrought; the
scientist and the craftsman achieve them;
the scholar and the artist interpret them.
Thus associated, they make their finest
contribution to the common life. The
builders construct the great monuments
of iron and of concrete which are the expression
of this age, as the great cathedrals
and abbeys were of generations that
have passed. Adapted as they are to the
needs of this day, our artists and our writers
have shown us the beauty and the art
which the modern handiwork of man possesses.
With etcher's tool one man of keen
insight has shown us the art that inheres
in the lofty structures which line the great
thoroughfares of our chief cities, the beauty
of the skylines they trace with roof and
pediment. With burning words another has
given voice to machinery and to the vehicles
of modern industry, and we thrill to
the eloquence and glow of his poetic
fervor.</p>

<p>"Great works of art are useful works
greatly done," declares Dr. T. J. Cobden-Sanderson,
and rightly viewed the most
prosaic achievements of this age, whether
they be great canals or clusters of
workmen's homes worthily built, or maybe
more humble projects, have a greatness
of meaning that carries with it the sense
of beauty and of art.</p>

<p>In medieval days, the heralds of civilization
were the warrior, the missionary, the
explorer and the troubadour; in modern
times, civilization is carried forward by
the chemist, the engineer, the captain of
industry, and the interpreter of life&mdash;whether
the medium utilized be pen or
brush or voice. Without vision, civilization
would wither and perish, and so it
may well be that the printed page shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
serve as symbol of its supreme vision.
Within the compass of the book sincerely
written, rightly chosen, and well used are
contained the three chief elements which
justify the library of the people&mdash;information,
education, recreation.</p>

<p>The urge of the world makes these demands;
ours is the high privilege to respond.</p>

them. I have been able to get some of
these discarded books for use in a Boys'
Club here in Cornwall. They were well
chosen for what I wanted and the boys
have been responsive and interested in taking
them out. This is simply one of the
things that the public libraries are doing
with the books they are through with and
can use no more.</p>

<p>In reply to your letter of April 1st, written
on behalf of the American Library Association,
I do consider that to a certain
extent the fiction circulated in the public
libraries of the United States does help to
enlighten the people on social and economic
problems. But I am bound to say
that I think that we novelists might do a
very great deal more in this direction if</p>

<p>we would avoid sentimentalizing the truth
in order to make it seem more palatable,
and also if we would adopt the habit of describing
more completely the general social
background against which our leading
figures live and move.</p>

<p class="right">Drama League of America,<br />
Chicago, Ill.</p>

<p>In the last three years the American people
as a whole have begun to awaken to a
realization of the vast importance of our
amusements in the nation's life. We are
realizing that we are far behind the other
civilized countries in the development of
our dramatic taste, and we are beginning
to be uneasy over the danger of being too
careless in regard to our recreation. The
people at large are commencing to take a
genuine interest in the problems presented
by our theater, and the character of the
plays they give.</p>

<p>We have arrived at a period of prosperity
when we have time, at last, to pay
attention to the arts, and especially the
last to be developed, the dramatic art. We
are uneasy over the conditions in our theaters
today.</p>

<p>Vaguely the people as a whole are feeling
around for one means or another to
correct these conditions, to create a great
national art and to restore drama to her
proper place among the arts. One movement
after another has aimed to meet
these conditions&mdash;new theaters&mdash;municipal
theaters, censorship laws,&mdash;every sort of
reform. It has remained for the Drama
League of America to place its finger
upon the really vital issue. For the actual
fault of the present situation lies with the
easy going American public. You cannot
create a New Theater without a public
to support it; you cannot force art on an
unwilling public no matter how large an A
you use in spelling it. In fact, your reforms
must begin the other side of the footlights;
and if we are to have better plays
upon our stage, if we are to do away with
the meretricious plays now too frequently
there, we must work with this great pleasure-loving
good-natured public, and cultivate
in it a taste for better drama.</p>

<p>We must create a demand for good
drama and the supply will follow&mdash;the dramatist,
actor and manager are only too
willing to fall into line, if the public can be
induced to refuse the worthless play and
support better drama. The really vital
and necessary thing is to secure a public
which will enjoy and support good plays.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Hence, it has become an important and
basic matter to improve the dramatic
tastes of the country. In fact, in the opinion
of many, this is one of the great problems
we have before us as a nation today.</p>

<p>Organized with this very object, the
Drama League of America has worked for
three years on the problem. In those three
years it has discovered many things. One
of these is, that there is a real and genuine
response to the appeal of the written
drama; that the message of the play need
not be restricted to the city with a theater,
but that through the printed play every
community may be reached. Another point
worked out by the league is the absolute
assurance that the best and in fact the
only way to improve the dramatic taste
of the country is to inculcate a thorough
knowledge of good drama&mdash;an intimate acquaintance
with the best plays written.
As many of these plays are rarely acted
now, or if acted are confined to the big
cities, the third point easily follows, that
by means of the printed play we can gradually
so inoculate the entire nation with a
knowledge of good drama and what it
really is that it will turn instinctively from
the cheap and worthless play and demand
better things. Consequently the first and
most important matter is to make good
drama accessible to every one. By spreading
knowledge of the best plays of the past
and present, all over the country, we are
improving the dramatic taste of the nation
and paving the way for better conditions
in the theaters.</p>

<p>In this effort to increase the reading of
plays the Drama League not unnaturally
turned early in its career to the libraries,
feeling itself largely dependent upon them
for the full development of its work. The
keenest response has come in return. Over
73 libraries are represented in our membership
and keep on file the league literature.
The testimony from these libraries
is most encouraging. On every side we find
the libraries eager to help in this development
of public dramatic taste.</p>

<p>Since the only way to improve dramatic
taste is by acquiring a thorough knowledge
of plays, it is palpably apparent that
the libraries can be the greatest possible
help in this new movement. To illustrate
concretely&mdash;The Drama League enters a
medium sized town with one public library,
inducing the two or three women's clubs
to take up each a course in modern drama,
interesting the teachers in the high school
in the league's high school course, even
persuading the grade school to do drama
work with the younger pupils. Usually
there are formed also several little reading
circles. Of course, the first demand is
for the published plays. The students flock
to the libraries to get the desired dramas.</p>

<p>In Chicago the testimony has come many
times that since the organization of The
Drama League public interest has been so
keen that the demand for dramas has been
phenomenal. Is the library content merely
to recognize this condition? By no means.
The Drama Department has had to quadruple
its supply, and even then is frequently
obliged to hold the books in for
reference only in order to meet the demand.
But see what this has meant to the
league to have that quadruple supply of
the dramas demanded by its members.
From Washington comes the testimony
that the organization of the league has increased
the demand for drama books; from
Los Angeles came a large order for special
dramas and reference books needed by
our members. The Massachusetts State
Library has offered to meet any demands
made upon it. Librarians in various communities
are officers and directors in this
new movement.</p>

<p>May I suggest a few ways in which the
libraries can help us? In the first place,
it will be a real benefit to any community
if its library will become a member of The
Drama League and keep its literature on
file. In this way the community is kept
informed through the Drama League bulletins
of the best current plays by its critical
analysis; it has access also to the study
courses and bibliographies on drama prepared
by the league's experts. Secondly,
it would be an inestimable help in this task
of improving dramatic taste of the community
if the library would be sure to
have on hand all the dramas listed in our
study and reading courses. Thirdly, if the
libraries would arrange a handy shelf of
worthy drama where "he who runs may
read," where the passerby would be attracted
by a drama and pick it up to
read it, it might induce a taste for better
plays, a knowledge of good drama in a
previously heedless theater goer. In Evanston,
Illinois, for three years this shelf has
been maintained in the library by the
Drama Club. Every few weeks a new
selection of dramas is placed on this little
book rack which stands near the main
call desk. It is much used and very popular.</p>

<p>The library could also helpfully publish
a separate list of its books on drama and
dramas, or better yet arrange them in a
separate section. Such a list is published
yearly by the Evanston Library and several
other libraries have recently adopted
this plan&mdash;notably the Newberry Library,
Chicago, and the Kansas City Library.</p>

<p>Another way in which the libraries can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
co-operate in raising dramatic taste, is
by making it easy for the playgoer to
read the dramas which have been published
and are to be presented in his city.
By co-operation with the Drama League
the library might receive word in advance
when a published worthy play is to be
given in town. It could then see to it
either that its copy of that play is withdrawn
from circulation and held for reference
only, or it could secure extra copies
of the play to meet the extra demand.
If it could be thoroughly understood that
the library was doing this, interest in reading
the play could be stimulated. For instance,
the library could post a notice
stating the coming of the play to town,
side by side with the league bulletin or
criticism of the play, and the announcement
that it could be secured at the book
shelf. With this active help of the libraries
we might go far toward securing
a trained dramatic taste on the part of
our theater goers. There are several
magazines of special value to the student
of drama. It would be a very great help
if the libraries made a special point of
including these among their subscriptions
and of listing them under the Drama Department&mdash;as
for instance, the Drama
Quarterly, and Poet Lore print in each
issue a play which has never been printed
in translation before, and which cannot be
secured elsewhere. These are extremely
valuable to the drama student. The Drama
Quarterly, moreover, is especially adapted
to the needs of the student of drama, and
should be accessible to him. It aims to
criticise the various books on drama and
dramas of special excellence, also publishing
notices of the most recent drama movements
in this country and abroad. It is
not used for league propaganda, but was
taken over by The Drama League merely
because it was in danger of being abandoned.
Moreover, in Current Opinion and
Hearst's Magazine are frequently printed
very valuable portions of unpublished new
plays. With every issue of L'Illustration
is published a new French drama in
French. It would be an excellent thing
if the larger or better equipped libraries
could excerpt the plays from these magazines
and have them sewed up simply, each
complete by itself, and kept with the other
dramas. In this way the library could
make an excellent modern drama department
readily accessible to the league members,
obtainable in no other way, and at
very slight cost to the library.</p>

<p>A very important way in which the
Library Association might help is one
which may not be practical, but which
your convention might be able to work
out for us. It is in the nature of loan
libraries. As we introduce our study
courses into the small towns we frequently
find no library facilities along our lines.
One of our workers made an investigation
of the Drama Department in libraries in
small towns of five to ten thousand inhabitants
in the Middle West, and found that
without exception all of those she visited,
had only Shakespeare and Faust, with occasionally
a volume of L'Aiglon. It is easy
to see how difficult it will be for clubs and
individuals to take up a study of drama
under such conditions. Is there any way
in which the large state libraries can prepare
a loan library at very slight cost,
made up of books desired for this special
work, which could be borrowed by the
local library for the use of its clubs? Of
course, in some states, as in Wisconsin and
New York, and probably many others, this
is covered by the traveling libraries; but
there are very many where this is not so.
Cannot the libraries go even farther in
their effort to improve dramatic taste and
meet the demand for dramas and books on
dramas, a demand which the Drama
League is attempting to create?</p>

<p>Several libraries in various cities, as notably
Chicago and Washington, have opened
their rooms for Drama League meetings.
Cannot this be done in other cities? Surely
any way in which you, as public institutions,
can increase the interest in good
drama, is a part of your proper function.
The league work must go hand in hand
with the libraries. Without you and your
resources, your wisdom and your co-operation,
we would be much crippled and
sadly curtailed in our possibilities of
achievements. On the other hand, now that
the development of a national taste for
better drama is becoming recognized as a
necessity in order to effect any improvement
in the conditions of our stage today,
now that we fully recognize that the best
way to create a better dramatic taste is
by familiarity with the best in drama, now
that we are working to make the reading
of plays popular and wide spread, does
it not become a very important branch
of the library's activity to take every step
possible to increase the reading of plays
and the thorough knowledge of dramatic
literature on the part of young and old?</p>

<p>The real opportunity is with the children.
Here we can create a fine dramatic taste
for the future, and here, too, the library
can help. In your junior corner, can you
not have the plays recommended on our
junior list, as suitable for children in order
that they may have them for their play
acting? Can you not start a Junior League
Drama Circle to read and act little chil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>dren's
plays, just as you have your story
hour? In this way the library is helping
us prepare the audiences of the future
which shall not only support better
drama, but being thoroughly inoculated
with an instinctive dramatic taste, will
positively demand worthy drama. So will
the libraries and The Drama League, representing
the universities, schools, clubs
and individuals in general have aroused
the public conscience to a realization of
its responsibilities for the amusements of
the people.</p>

<p>In reply to your letter of April 21 I
can only say that I am not familiar enough
with the conduct of American libraries
to make any new suggestions on the question
you propose. I think the plan followed
by the Providence Public Library is
the best one to encourage the reading of
the standard works of literature. It has,
as you of course know, a pleasant room,
easily accessible, in which attractive editions
of the best authors can be read.
Would it be feasible to supplement this
plan by publishing, from time to time, interesting,
short descriptions of standard
books, giving prospective readers some notion
of the subject and peculiar attraction
of each&mdash;somewhat after the manner
of publishers' alluring (or would-be alluring)

<p>Your letter of the fourteenth, inviting
me to contribute to a symposium of thought
concerning library work in America and
suggesting the topic, "What is your conception
of the ideal librarian," does me
great honor. But it brings to my mind
very clearly my inability to offer a definition
which I could possibly hope would
be enlightening or stimulating to a convention
of librarians.</p>

<p>The library work of our present day
has expanded into such liberal bounds
and taken on such a missionary, and at
the same time scientific, spirit that one
who is merely its beneficiary cannot give
himself the hardihood to offer words of
criticism or of counsel. I know no work
which shows such splendid contrasts to
what it was when I began life as does
the profession of the public librarian and
the professional conception of the library's
mission to the world.</p>

<p>It has been my great joy and honor to
bring up a large family whose members
are now separated and busy in the world's
work and it gives me great pleasure to
say of them, as of myself, that the modern
management of public libraries has made
life worth incalculably more than it could
have been under the limitations of forty
years ago.</p>

<p>It gives me great pleasure to attempt
a brief answer to the question you suggest&mdash;"Is
the fiction circulated by our
public libraries helping to enlighten the
people on social and economic problems?"
I should be inclined to answer the question
decidedly in the affirmative. In addition
to the letters I receive from persons
whose only access to modern fiction is
through the public library, concerning my
own work, I have, in the course of political
campaigns, and in places in various parts
of the country where I have made another
sort of address, held many conversations
with men and women in the audiences.
These have interested me greatly. My
own experience corroborates a fact to
which I have heard several librarians at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>test
(and it is to me the most hopeful
phenomenon in our American life), that
the American public&mdash;mainly through the
libraries&mdash;is reading more widely and more
intelligently than those who do not come
into direct contact with a large portion of
it guess. Four or five months ago I received
a letter from a poor woman who
lives on a farm near one of the larger
towns of Massachusetts giving me a list
of the books she had got from the library
during the past year. She had read them
all; and they included, in addition to two
good biographies and Royce's "Loyalty,"
several of the best recent novels, both
English and American, dealing seriously
with the problems of modern life. And
finally, the other day when I was in San
Francisco, I had a long conversation with
an ex-burglar who had served a term in
the penitentiary, and who has reformed
and has been for the last eight years making
an honest living, on the subject of
such novels as you mention. His comments
on them were not only interesting
but often valuable. His source was, of
course, the public library. Hence, I am
glad of this opportunity to pay my tribute
to the librarian, and to express, as an
American citizen, my appreciation of the
work he is doing.</p>

<p>The public libraries have no better opportunity
for effective service than that
offered through generous and intelligent
co-operation with the public schools and
especially with the high schools and the
highest grades of the grammar schools.
Ideas and ideals gained through reading
in childhood and youth effect the character
more fundamentally and more permanently,
and determine moral conduct for a longer
time than ideas and ideals gained later.
It should also be remembered that children
have more time to read than men and
women immersed in the strong current of
adult life.</p>

<p>The public library in every city and
town should be open on the freest terms
to all school children and they should
feel that they have the heartiest welcome
to it. Not only should the teacher encourage
children to use the library; librarians
should invite them to do so and
make all possible preparations to serve
them. There should be in the libraries
a sufficient number of reading rooms to
accommodate children of different grades.
In these should be assistant librarians
who know the very best in literature for
children and youth and who know also
how to deal with children and how to make
the rooms attractive. It is all important
that the reading rooms and those in charge
be attractive, respected, liked, and loved.
It is especially important that children
be led to read those things that have
permanent and eternal value. No one
should be permitted to direct the reading
of children who thinks it necessary to
have books written down to them or who
does not know that the greatest books
are the simplest and the most wholesome.
The children's librarians should also be
whole minded and whole hearted people
with a broad and interesting knowledge
of the world and life. It will be fatal
if they are narrow, prejudiced, sectarian,
or over-provincial.</p>

<p>The public library should have the services
of one or more good story tellers
who know the best stories of the world
and can tell them in an interesting way.
As often as once a week at least there
should be a separate hour for all the
children. The children should, of course,
come in sections&mdash;primary, grammar
grades, and high school.</p>

<p>In addition to the services rendered as
here suggested at the library, all the
children in school or out should have library
cards and for the convenience of
the children every school building should
be made a branch library for the use of
children at least. I see no reason why it
should not also serve as a branch library
for the older people. It would not cost
much to have some one or more teachers
at each school serve as librarians under
the direction of the librarian of the central
library. Through the branch library at
the school many parents and other older
members of the family could be reached
who never can be reached through the
ordinary central and branch library buildings.
Attractive statements about books,
especially new books should be sent to
the parents by the children and books
might be ordered and returned through
the children. It would not be difficult to
induce pupils and teachers to arrange reading
circles and clubs among the adult
members of families living near the school,
the books used by the reading circles to
be ordered from and returned to the school
branch library. Teachers and principals
would also be willing to arrange for weekly
meetings for the members of these reading
circles and clubs, the meetings to
be held at the school. Certificates and
diplomas might be given for the reading
of certain groups of books.</p>

<p>The library should own in sets books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
helpful to teachers and children in their
studies and should, at the request of superintendents
and principals, place sets of
these in the several schools for use in
school, but not to be taken out except over
night or over Saturdays and Sundays and
holidays.</p>

<p>Libraries should also own large collections
of illustrative pictures and lantern
slides. These should be cataloged as books
are and lists of them should be in the
hands of school superintendents, supervisors,
principals, and teachers. The pictures
and slides should be loaned the
schools freely upon their request. School
officers and teachers should be asked to
assist in selecting these and all other collections
for the use of children.</p>

<p>The library should serve in this way not
only the schools of the city, but also the
country and village schools in the counties
in which they are located. Through the
country schools more good can be accomplished,
frequently, than through the city
schools. Country boys and girls are more
eager to read than city boys and girls.
They have more time for it and will read
better books. The library should have
a direct relation with every school and
every teacher in the county. Of course,
the county should pay for this service,
but it should have it whether it pays for
it or not. The city cannot afford to withhold
it. The city depends on the country
for its prosperity and life. The children
now in the country will make up a large
part of the population of the city twenty
or twenty-five years from now.</p>

<p>In many places the public libraries are
doing all these things to some extent; in
no place to as great an extent as is possible.
By using to the best advantage
the opportunities here suggested, public
libraries may double their usefulness.</p>

<p>The Negro American is being helped
greatly by public libraries wherever he is
given reasonable encouragement to enter
them. Often in the North, he is not made
to feel welcome in these libraries and in
most of the public and private libraries
of the South, he is rigorously excluded. It
would seem that a statement from the
American Library Association to the effect
that the color line in literature is silly, is
much needed at present.</p>

<p>Of course, the financial return for money
expended to maintain a public library cannot
be definitely stated, as may be done
in connection with municipal activities
which deal solely with material things.</p>

<p>It is impossible to trace along commercial
lines the influence upon the community
of an institution whose prime purpose is
not profit, is not even a product that can
be expressed in terms of dollars, but is
the enlargement of the individual life, and
the promotion of higher standards of citizenship.</p>

<p>On the lowest and most sordid plane
however, an institution like the Boston
public library is worth many times its cost
to the city merely on account of the number
of persons from abroad who are attracted
to the building as an example of
monumental architecture, or because it contains
exceptional works of art in its mural
decorations, or who visit it as a museum
of rare and interesting books. These visitors
number thousands yearly; many of
them stay in the city for several days,
and their entertainment and their expenditure
of money while they remain, add to
the commercial prosperity of the city.</p>

<p>In somewhat the same way, but on a
much higher plane, directly within the
scope of the library function, numbers of
students are yearly drawn to the city by
the advantages the library offers for intellectual
research. And the library enhances
the importance and value of the
various schools and colleges within our
borders, by enlarging their intellectual resources.</p>

<p>In other directions the value of the library
to the community is evident. The
fact that it is here adds something to
the value of every estate in the city. Persons
seeking a desirable place of residence
prefer a city or town which has good
schools and a well-equipped and adequately
supported library to a place without these
institutions, even if no direct use is made
by such persons of either. The influence
of a good library on the general conditions
in a community is therefore a profitable
asset.</p>

<p>In assimilating the different elements of
a mixed and rapidly growing population,
the work of the library is obvious, and
its results far outweigh their cost. And
the increased efficiency of individuals,
which the library promotes, has its effect
in inestimable public benefits. For example,
to take a single possible case
out of many, here is a young man without
money or influence but who has talent
which, if properly fostered may become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the source of power. Through the opportunities
for study given by the public library
he perfects an invention, or writes
a poem, or enters a useful profession by
means of which he ministers to the comfort
and enjoyment of his fellow-men and
confers honor upon this city. How can
one over-estimate the social value of such
lives, or the part which the library has
played in their development? Such instances
are by no means few, and unquestionably
they supply an affirmative answer
to the question as to whether or
not the library is making an adequate return
for its cost.</p>

<p>Your question, "Is the fiction circulated
by our public library helping to enlighten
people on social and economic problems?"
is one which I can answer promptly and
affirmatively. Looking at fiction in the
mass, it is without doubt an enormous
educational influence. Leaving out of view
for the moment the historical novel, or
the sociologic novel, and taking merely the
local novel, the novel which vividly portrays
the life of a special village, or country,
or nation, we find it of the greatest
service in teaching the people of one country,
or class, how the people of other countries
and other classes live. Such books
bring the ends of the earth together. They
unite the north and the south, the east and
the west, in common sympathy and understanding.
They contribute very largely to
the higher patriotism, as well as to the
profounder social brotherhood.</p>

<p>It would be easy to criticise fiction for
other and less valuable content, but speaking
generally, I believe it to be second only
to the stage in its power to affect the
young student of life and manners.</p>

<p>You ask for comment&mdash;as "related particularly
with their own special <b>interests</b>"
and at the risk of being charged with
"talking shop," I have been brutally frank.
Yet I hope it will cheer these splendid
workers for civilization.</p>

<p>The library is <b>not</b> "doing as much as
it might to be a true University to the
People." Books alone will not attract the
insensitive or indifferent, nor will handsome
buildings. Equal to other necessity
of the library to be "a true university to
the people," <b>is that of arousing interest,
awakening curiosity and alluring into path
ways that lead to books and reading</b>. I
know of nothing better than to have cheap,
popular, illustrated lecture courses that
constantly refer to books and the special
theme.</p>

<p>Does the local librarian or do active
directors, attempt seriously to tap the
knowledge of the local specialist, professional
man, or public spirited speaker?
Do the library people emphasize the necessity
of close, personal contact, as far as
possible, with the individuals and with
the people? Libraries must be more
human. No machinery, or salaried personnel,
however costly or efficient, within
chosen lines of activity, can do without
that same human sympathy, which in other
professions, is known to outweigh in value,
all edifices, or the paid professional corps;
yes, even in religion or philanthropy. Not
all, but most libraries&mdash;and I have looked
in, and at, and around many&mdash;are too self-centered.</p>

<p>Yet with this criticism, honestly called
for and as honestly given, none can appreciate
the librarian more than I. To guide
youthful reading, warning as well as advising
and alluring them to high flights,
is to make the librarian's calling <b>second
to none</b> in our complex civilization.</p>

<p>My experience is a long one with university
libraries, but I have had far less
to do with public libraries.</p>

<p>The greatest need of the specialist and
expert is help in finding all, and especially
the latest, often very scattered, literature
on the special point on which he is conducting
his research, and I believe that in
the future every academic library will have
a few specialists with a good knowledge
of languages, of Ph. D. rank, who can
do just this. We have one such here,
to whom my work owes more than to anybody
else. If I ask her to find me, e. g.,
all the recent references on a topic, be it
ever so special, including perhaps a score
of archives and special journals, back for
three or five years as I may specify, up to
the latest arrival, I get this list, which
always includes many things our library
does not have, then take it to the librarian,
who can generally get about everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
by borrowing far and near. These, together
with the resources here, are placed
upon a table in an alcove where I can work
or take the books home. This makes a
perfectly ideal condition, and it is at the
same time indispensable for advanced special
work, and everything in a university
library should be plastic to this end.</p>

<p>A public librarian, it seems to me, should
study all the changing interests in a community
or in special parts of it, and be able
to print in the daily press whenever any
topic is prominent a little article telling
in a few lines the point of a few books
or articles; e. g. a manual training high
school is opened. The daily paper should
state that the library has a good collection
of literature up to date on that subject
(if it has), and give a few points from
a few of the best books, naming them. A
few titles are not enough.</p>

<p>Another point that interests me greatly
is the library story telling. I think more
should be done, not less, in this line for
children, and that books illustrating topics
in geography, history, etc., should be not
only laid before teachers but that the
classes should meet there and have the
things shown to them. Why does not the
public library go into some of the wonderful
illustrative material in the above
and other topics, which is so characteristic
of German schools, and of which American
schools know almost nothing? Our educational
Museum here has lately spent thousands
of dollars and collected thousands of
these illustrations all the way from wall
pictures to bound pictures, illustrating material
from primary grades up into college,
which we loan as we do books to teachers,
parents and others. There is a very great
new departure possible here. Why does
not your Association look into this? It
has been a great find for us. And about
everything in our large collection and its
use, to my mind, might be done by public
libraries although none of them that I
know of has done much of anything along
that line. I am</p>

<p>While I am not at all a specialist in library
science and art, I am daily a debtor
to your profession. In answer to the question&mdash;"What
rank should the library have
in the scale of the community's social assets?"&mdash;I
should indicate the following
hints of an argument: The income of every
family is increased by the possession and
use of a public library. This item is never
found set down in the accounts of a family
as a part of their income, and the students
of budgets are too apt to overlook it; but
all communal property, as lake fronts,
parks, playgrounds, public schools, public
free libraries and reading rooms, are so
much addition to the enjoyments of all
who have the taste and inclination to use
them. As the library contains the very
best thoughts of the greatest men and
women of all time, I should say that the
public free library is among the very highest
possessions of the people.</p>

<p>When we consider the dangers of idleness
or of a depraved use of leisure, and
when we consider the splendid opportunity
of spiritual growth which comes from intelligent
and systematic daily use of the
library, we must place this institution
among the highest agencies of social amelioration
and progress. Every year sees
improvement in the administration of this
noble trust by the professional custodians
and administrators. There is manifest
everywhere a spirit of courtesy, patience
and enterprise, which does honor to this
branch of the profession of educators. The
librarian and his assistants are colleagues
of instructors in all institutions of every
grade, and those of us who are teaching
feel ourselves to be under profound obligations
to our companions in service.</p>

<p>I have your letter of April 2nd in which
you are good enough to ask me to write a
few lines on the topic: "Should the public
library exercise censorship over the books
it circulates?"</p>

<p>I suppose there is no question that the
good public library should <b>have</b> somewhere
in its shelves all books of serious intent,
and should circulate in a restricted and
properly guarded way <b>any</b> book no matter
what its subject matter. So the question
comes down to the propriety of circulating
generally without restriction all sorts of
books. I should hesitate to say that a public
library should exercise no supervision
over its circulation, although I myself have
suffered from what I consider unjust and
unmerited notoriety&mdash;due to the prescient
sensibilities of certain librarians, as you
know. But when you will admit the principle
of censorship, the matter is a delicate
one, of course. It would seem to me,
for example, unwise to circulate freely
books of medicine. As to fiction&mdash;or what
publishers call "the general list" of books,
I think an intelligent librarian should hesitate
a long time before putting on his or
her <b>index expurgatorius any publications</b>
vouched for by the imprint of a <b>reputable</b><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
publishing firm. For such books have actually
passed a severe censorship before
being put out. I realize it is all a personal
matter, for what to me is good red meat
may be poison to my brother. I think,
for instance, that such a novel as The
Rosary is infinitely more pernicious than
the Kreutzer Sonata, La Terre, or Germinal,
but the average librarian wouldn't.
So I am afraid the matter will have to
stand just where it is today&mdash;a book will
be censored as unfit or unclean according
to the whim of the individual librarian.
Presumably the public librarian is at least
abreast of, if not superior in culture and
idealism to his community, and as our communities
improve our librarians will become
persons of wider intelligence and culture
than they are now in some cases and
exercise their censorial powers with more
real discrimination.</p>

<p>Apropos of this matter you may be interested
to know that a few months ago
the New York Post in an editorial protest
against certain young American realists
and their treatment of sex&mdash;instanced
Mr. Howells and myself as examples of
"clean American reticent realism!" This,
after all the roar over "Together" is an
amusing illustration of growth in critical
opinion. Mr. Howells sent me the editorial
but I haven't it with me.</p>

<p class="center">Truthfully,
</p>

<p class="right">ROBERT HERRICK.</p>

<p>P. S. My own views on the proper treatment
of sex in fiction will be briefly

fiction to be printed in the Yale Review
before long.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="right">Chicago, May 17, 1913.</p>

<p>You ask me "is the fiction circulated by
our public libraries helping to enlighten
the people on social and economic problems?"
That is a question which a librarian
can answer better than any author.
In general, it seems to me, magazine fiction
is doing more in that line than book
fiction. Some of the greatest circulations
ever attained by periodicals have been
built upon a shrewd knowledge of the
American materialism. One editor voices
it:&mdash;"Americans are interested about two-thirds
in business, and one-third in love."
That editorial policy has won in this country.</p>

<p>As to social and economic problems,
more properly considered, I don't think
fiction is doing much for the people. This
really is the fault of the people, or of
human nature, or rather of American human
nature. I think we are one of the
most neurotic and hysterical people in the
world, which means that presently we shall
be one of the most swiftly decadent people
in the world. For this reason, we have
sudden fashions in fiction. Just now we
like to read about "action" of heroic
sort&mdash;precisely as we pay to see baseball
games instead of playing baseball ourselves.
Also, we are for the time given
over to a wave of erotic fiction, just this
side of indecent. At one time we were
crazy over historical fiction, before that,
over dialect fiction, before that over analytical
fiction. Therefore, I should say that
our book fiction does not and cannot do
much in the way of handling social and
economic problems at the present day.
Once in a while, we have a political novel,
machine-made, and like all other political
novels. Sometimes, we get a business
novel, in turn like all other business novels.
We don't have really very many thoughtful
novels good enough to be called big. I
fancy it would not pay authors to write
them, or public libraries to buy them.
We are having a period of business and
political sack cloth and ashes, but, drunk
or sober, broke or prosperous, the American
character seems to me annually to
grow more hectic and hysterical, and less
inclined to care for big things and good
stuff. Part of this is the fault of our
newspapers, but most of it is our own fault.
We care for making money and for little
else, and we spend money whether we have
it or not. The public libraries would be
the natural agency for correcting some of
these things, but frankly I don't know how
they could do it.</p>

<p>Why should not the libraries amplify the
work they are already doing by the promotion
of the public schools as well as
libraries as social and civic centers?
Schoolhouses should be constructed with
all equipments for branch libraries, just
as they are now equipped with gymnasiums
and baths. The library should not be an
accident in the public school; it should be
an integral part of it. The schoolhouse
is the natural place for the library. To
it the children come daily&mdash;little messengers
who would secure books from printed
slips for their parents, too tired or too
distant from the library to serve themselves.
The library should be the school
rest and reading room. It would relieve
the tedium of regular school work. It
would lend variety to education; it would
enrich it and beautify it.</p>

<p>In addition, great economy would be effected
by converting the school into a li<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>brary;
there would be a saving in construction,
in maintenance, in operation. The
fine social sense of the modern librarian
would have a reaction on education and
would lead to other activities being introduced
into the schools.</p>

<p>The American library is the model of
the world in many ways. It has led the
movement for the widening of public services
to old and young. It is one of the
most inspirational achievements of the
American city, and it could do a substantial
service by promoting the social center idea,
which is so actively engaging the minds
of people all over the country.</p>

<p>In response to your kind invitation to
send a brief message on the subject&mdash;"Can
public libraries legitimately attempt amusement
as well as instruction of the people?"
I would reply to the affirmative. If literature
is an art, and if libraries are to be
as they should be&mdash;reservoirs of literature&mdash;they
surely cannot be complete without
giving an important place to arts' most
human appeal, amusement. The novel, invented
to amuse, stands today as the vital
force in literature. Of course, by "amusement"
I do not mean a vaudeville. Shakespeare
wrote to amuse; and if he does not
offer a popular line today it is because
modern writers are better chosen to amuse
our century. Indeed, if you remove the
fiction department&mdash;the amusement section&mdash;from
your library you reduce it to the
plans of a machine&mdash;an admirable machine,
perhaps&mdash;but without a human soul to
drive it.</p>

<p>The specific question which you propound,
"What can the library do to encourage
the study of American history?"
is one which I suppose must have very
different answers for different sorts of libraries.
In the case of libraries of moderate
size in small cities, it has sometimes
appeared to me that the money used in the
purchase of books on American history was
too exclusively used in buying the less
expensive sort of books, those in one or
two or three volumes, of which it is perfectly
easy to get a considerable number
out of each year's appropriations; while on
the other hand, the purchase of certain
books of value in expensive sets was never
made, because it could not easily be made
in any one given year. If the purchasing
policy were given a somewhat longer
range, extending over several years, one
might plan to redress this inequality. To
avoid speaking as if I were recommending
any one long set of Americana for purchase,
let me adduce as an instance a
library of forty or fifty thousand volumes
with which I am familiar which has in the
past twenty years bought a great many
books of English history, without ever yet
having afforded the purchase of the <b>Dictionary
of National Biography</b>, obviously
because it was too large a morsel for any
one year's budget.</p>

<p>If I were to proceed to make any suggestion
for the larger libraries, I might
select for comment the relative lack of
co-operation among such libraries in respect
to the pursuit of the more expensive
specialties. It is plain that the interest of
students are, in respect to restricted specialties
of this class better served on the
whole by their being able to find relatively
complete collections in one place, rather
than scattered fragments of such collections
in various places. The ambition of
libraries for possession might well be tempered
by some closer approach to systematic
organization of these things, whereby
certain ones should be recognized as belonging
plainly in the field of a certain
library without competition on the part
of the others. I am speaking, of course,
of things which only a few students are
seeking, and which they must expect to
seek by travel, and not of those things
for which there is a separate effective
demand in every large city.</p>

<p>May I also suggest the question whether
it is not a legitimate use of the funds
of a public library to pay recognized experts,
resident in its city or summoned
from elsewhere, to go over the shelves
relating to a particular subject and carefully
signalize those gaps which are almost
certain to occur; to name, in other
words, any important books which have
been omitted but which are necessary
to make the collection a well-rounded one
for the needs of the particular locality as
the librarian sees them. I think also that
university and college libraries are particularly
in need of such periodical redress,
because professors are so prone
to request books needed for the immediate
purposes of their classes, and to exhaust
their appropriations by such requests, forgetting
the need of building up rounded
collections for general purposes; and the
librarian, on his part, feels a certain delicacy
about suggesting books for which the
professor has evinced no desire, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
often he will agree they were desirable, if
their absence were called to his attention.

<p>I have your recent letter asking for
some brief comment on such phase of library
work as most appeals to me.</p>

<p>At present, in accord with the trend
of current thought in other matters, I am
inclined to lay stress on efficiency; and
under that head I would urge that librarians,
especially in the smaller places, do
much strenuous and persistent weeding
among the books that find their way to the
shelves. Feed the furnace with the books
that are no longer useful in your particular
library, or in some other way absolutely
dispose of them.</p>

<p>Much of the fiction, both for grown-ups
and young people, should go, after the first
interest in it has waned. Many also of the
information books decline in value with
the passing years and should not remain
a permanent incubus. Very few of the
government publications are of practical
use in the average library.</p>

<p>We have altogether too much veneration
for printed matter. Library housecleanings

<p>In response to your kind letter of April
5th, and after refreshing my mind by consultation
with librarian friends, with
your kind permission I may say a word
on the theme, "That librarians should
sometimes take account of stock," that
they should consider the reasons for their
existence and find out how nearly their
present day activities coincide with the
purposes for which they are established.</p>

<p>With one or two notable exceptions public
libraries in the United States are a development
of the last quarter of the 19th
Century. Until about 1895, or possibly
1900 the efforts of librarians were directed
toward perfecting methods of administration,
cataloging, etc. Then having
arrived at mutual agreement as to forms of
procedure they devoted themselves more
and more to library extension. They realized
that only fractions of their respective
communities were in touch with the libraries.
In a city of 400,000 inhabitants
perhaps 40,000 or 10 per cent would make
use of library privileges, and the circulation
of a million volumes per year meant
the use of only 2&frac12; books per year for
each inhabitant. Then commenced the era
of branch libraries, deposit stations, libraries
in schools, libraries in factories,
in fire-houses; a resort to every possible
means to extend usefulness of the library
throughout the whole community. Not satisfied
with these expedients other forms
of extension are being adopted. I am told
that "one library publishes a weekly paper
heralding the advantages of its city. It
has established a business man's information
branch, compiled an index to the
products manufactured within the city,
and holds itself ready to give information
as to where the best tennis balls, suit
cases and everything else can be purchased."
Undoubtedly this is a public
convenience, but it seems to be getting a
little away from original library purposes.
There is a tendency for libraries to so
scatter their energies that they lose sight
of the main objects of their being. They
exhibit the same tendency which can be
seen in the curricula of many colleges
which offer courses upon every conceivable
subject, the lasting value of which to those
who pursue them is certainly questionable.</p>

<p>Libraries are not exempt from the prevalent
tendency of municipal, state and
federal agencies to extend their activities
and increase the burden of taxes. It is
safe to say that in many public libraries
the budgets have been more than doubled
in the last 15 years. It is a question
whether the real service to the community
has gained in proportion. It is not
necessary to make hourly deliveries to
downtown delivery stations of the latest
thing in fiction, but it is essential that
the libraries should do their utmost to
maintain ideals. The library which has
set apart in a separate room a collection
of standard literature has performed a
notable service for its community and furnished
an example worthy of imitation. It
is a part of the best work of the library
to assist in perpetuating only that which
is worthy of survival.</p>

<p>On the question you put me: "Are our
libraries helping to make better citizens
of those from over-seas?" I must decline
to give an answer. It would be somewhat
bold on the part of one who is not him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>self
a citizen of this country and whose
opportunities have been scant, for studying
such a problem, to express an opinion.</p>

<p>Concerning librarians, as such, I may
say that my experience with them, under
many climes and skies, has ever been of
the pleasantest. Their keeping company
with the thinkers and writers of all times,
spending their days in those temples
where the wisdom, the folly, the dreams,
the beauty of ages is stored for the contemplation
or warning of succeeding generations,
gives them, of whatever nationality
they be, a philosophical turn of mind, a
benevolent desire to help, a friendliness
to the untutored who want to know more.
For me they are the typical men of good
will for whom there will be peace.</p>

<p>"Can public libraries legitimately attempt
amusement as well as instruction of
the people?" Since you ask me the question,
I feel obliged to answer it in all seriousness.
In my opinion the public library
ought not to be turned into a place of
amusement. Let us have this one institution
left as a refuge from amusement.
The general desire of the public to be
amused has caused it to become almost
impossible for one to go anywhere or see
anything without becoming conscious of
the fact that the first and generally the
sole purpose of everything is to amuse.
The preachers make their sermons amusing,
the poets make their poems amusing,
the artists make their pictures amusing,
the merchants make their shops amusing;
one cannot eat in a public place without
being amused. Steamships and railway
trains are operated for the amusement of
passengers; every vacant storeroom will
by tomorrow have become a place of
amusement and plans are already being
made to convert funerals into amusing
affairs. Spare to us the one place in
which we may hope to escape from amusement.
Let the public library remain
grand, gloomy and peculiar.</p>

<p>In reply to your letter of April 5, 1913,
would say&mdash;The modern city library is
covering a most desirable field in meeting
the needs of a large element of the public,
which looks to it almost exclusively
for information along library and allied
lines. A popular library should be able
to supply information on all subjects of
a general character and should not proceed
along lines of reference facilities except
in a general way. This ground is
covered by private gifts and educational
institutions. The city library should, it
seems to me, be constituted along liberal
lines, adapted to entertain as well as instruct.
Any means adapted to stimulate
the public desire for the use of its privileges
properly guarded, cannot fail to be
of general benefit. Thus lectures, story
telling, art exhibits, and even victrola
concerts, loan of pianola rolls, etc., may
serve to induct the mind into the wealth
of knowledge embraced within its wonderful
collection of books. The portals
of the city library should be made insidiously
alluring, with the expectation that
once within them, the reader will go
farther.</p>

<p>
To My Fellow Workers in Libraries,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Greetings:</span><br />
</p>

<p>I always feel a little bashful when I go
into a strange library as I sometimes do
and happen on a librarian who confronts
me with things I say about librarians in
the "Lost Art of Reading." Usually I
speak up quite quickly and say to a librarian,
"Oh, but you know I do not mean
YOU!"</p>

<p>But in speaking as I am now to all the
librarians there are in the United States
and Canada this seems to be inconvenient.</p>

<p>I am afraid that if there were any nice
thoughtful benignant way of taking each
librarian in this great mass meeting, of all
the librarians there are, one side and
whispering to him quietly, "Oh, but you
know I do not mean YOU," I would probably
do it!</p>

<p>But being driven to it and being faced
out this way as I am today, two or three
thousand to one, there seems to be nothing
for it but to face the music and to
look you in the eye a minute and say once
for all, "I DO mean you, I mean each of
you and all of you," and I accuse you of not
taking immediate, powerful and conclusive
steps to convince donors of libraries and
the public of the rights of librarians, of
your right to perform your duties under
decent, spiritual conditions as members
of a high and spirited calling, as professional
men and women, as artists and as
fellow human beings and not as overworked,
under-assisted, weary servants of
books.</p>

<p>The charges against the library donors
and managers that I brought out in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
new book "Crowds," more particularly the
chapters, "Mr. Carnegie speaks up," and
"Mr. Carnegie tries to make people read,"
are charges that are going to be answered
most successfully by people who admit that
they are largely true and who will then
proceed tomorrow, before everybody, to
turn them into lies. The sooner the librarians
and trustees and public men of
this country proceed to make what I am
saying today about public libraries hopelessly
ridiculous and out-of-date, the sooner
I will be happy.</p>

<p>If I were to move into a strange community
and wanted to be a valuable citizen
in it, the first thing I would do would
be to go to the public library and ask
the librarians and their assistants this
question, "Who are the interesting boys
in this town?"</p>

<p>If the librarians could tell me I would
linger around, and in one way or another,
get acquainted with those boys, follow
them up and see what I could do to connect
them with the men with the books,
and ideas and ambitions and opportunities
that belong to them.</p>

<p>If the librarians could not give me a list
of such boys I would ask them why.</p>

<p>If they told me that they had not time
to attend to such things I would ask the
trustees why.</p>

<p>If the trustees had not selected librarians
naturally interested in boys and
books and had not provided such librarians
with the necessary assistants so they
would have time and spirit to do such
things I would turn to the people and
I would challenge the people to elect trustees
for their library who knew what a library
was for.</p>

<p>I sometimes think of the librarian in a
town as the Mayor Of What People Think,
and if he does not have time to read books
and to love ideas and inventions in himself
and in other people and does not take
time to like boys and get the ideas and
boys together, he cannot be in a town
where he lives, a good Mayor Of What
People Think.</p>

<p>We shall never have great libraries in
the United States until the typical librarian
exalts his calling and takes his place
in our modern life seriously&mdash;as the ruler
of our civilization, the creator of the environment
of a nation and as the dictator
of the motives and ideals of cities, the discoverer
of great men and the champion
of the souls of the people.</p>

<p>I candidly ask you all: What is there
that can be done in America in the way
of letting librarians keep on being folks?</p>

<p>One almost wishes that all the members
of the library association of America would
write to Andrew Carnegie, snow him under
with letters from the nation, asking
him to try the experiment of having at
least one of his libraries in the United
States fitted up as elaborately and as elegantly
with librarians as it is with dumb
waiters, marble pillars, book racks and
umbrella stands.</p>

<p>When we go into a library&mdash;some of us&mdash;we
want to feel our minds being gently
exposed to cross-fertilization. We may not
want librarians to throw themselves at
us&mdash;come down plump into our minds the
minute we enter whether or no, but we do
want when we come into a library to be
able to find (if we steal around a little),
eager, contagious, alluring librarians who
can make people read books and from
whom people cannot get away without
reading books. Every library ought to be
supplied with at least one librarian in
each department, stuck all over with
books, like burrs, so that nobody can touch
him or be near him without carrying away
a book on him that he's got to read and
that he will long to read and will read
until somebody drives him to bed!</p>

<p>Greetings and good wishes to the men
and women who hold the keys:</p>

<p>I saw in England, last year, a very old
library where the books are chained to
the shelves. They have always been
chained there; at first because they were
valuable and human nature was weak, and
now to preserve the tradition. But in general,
either because the value of books is
less or because human nature is less weak,
we trust our public with its books unchained.
The shelves of most libraries, I
understand, are open freely and the loss
of books is small&mdash;small enough to be disregarded,
you tell me, in relation to the
general good.</p>

<p>And not only is the public freely admitted.
In Northampton I have seen, many
times, the books put on wheels and traveling
out to the public; they are in a kind
of clothes-basket set on a truck with tiny
wheels; and the janitor trundles the truck
to the trolley, and the trolley carries the
books to Leeds or Florence or Williamsburg,
it may be&mdash;I do not know their destination.
I only see them traveling away
on wheels. This is only A-B-C to all of you.
Most of you could tell me much more
interesting things that libraries are doing.
Some of you have already seen that
it is not enough to put the books on wheels
and trundle them out to the public, but
that the public itself must be followed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
captured. You tell me that in the future
the library that would be really up-to-date
must catch its readers where it can and
chain books to them.</p>

<p>Presently we shall need wings to follow
life and bring it back to its books. For
life moves swiftly; and you who hold the
keys and who are putting books on wheels
and sending them out will not stop till the
life in books and the life of the world are
come together again. Presently we shall
all work for this. You have freed the
books, you have sent them out, you have
reached out to give them to us freely.
Presently you will unlock the books themselves
and open the pages; and the time
when a child studied only a few books
will belong to the past; the living use of
books will be a part of the life of every
child that is born into the world. Presently
we shall all work together for this&mdash;with
you who hold the keys.</p>

<p>The librarian's constant difficulty is now,
what shall a library try to collect, what
shall it keep? This has become a grave
question. Being myself book greedy, a
gourmand of print, I am a poor judge of
what to reject.</p>

<p>Soon or late the average man, who is presumed
to represent common sense, will ask,
"What is the use of these accumulations of
books?" This average man can never consider
a library with comment of imagination.
A book is for him a book, whereas
for you or me a book is a saint, a hero,
a martyr, a fool, a seraph of light bearing
science. Let us drop him with a word of
scorn. We shall not ever understand one
another. Nor would he have the faith in
books of that Samonicus who, for the cure
of a tertian fever in the Emperor Gordian,
ordered the fourth book of the Iliad
to be applied to the head of the patient.
That has long puzzled me&mdash;why the
fourth? But Mr. Average awaits a quotation.
A voice out of the splendid day
of Elizabeth shall say it: "Sir, he hath
not fed of the dainties that are bred of a
book; he hath not eat paper, as it were;
he hath not drunk ink."</p>

<p>I fear you must be charging me with
discourtesy for delaying so long my reply
to your letter of April 19th. I have in fact
had the intention of writing to you rather
fully on the subject of public libraries and
best sellers, for use in your conference in
Kaaterskill. One obligation after another,
however, has kept me from doing this
and now I can only express to you briefly
my conviction that the public library ought
by no means to undertake "to supply all
the best sellers hot from the press." It
has always seemed to me that the office of
any institution such as the library is as
much to direct and restrain public taste
as it is to supply what is demanded.</p>

is not too late to answer your question and
I am writing now simply to acknowledge
receipt of your letter. I will, however,
say that I believe that the circulation of
fiction by our public libraries does help to
enlighten the people on all problems whatsoever,
for, in the first place, fiction contains
many of the standard novels which
certainly have a tendency for good; and
secondly, however trashy novels are, in
the main they have an educating effect.</p>

<p>I cannot better comply with your request
(made on behalf of the American
Library Association) than by giving you a
leaf from my own experience of twenty-five
years, as President or managing director
of a rural library, which serves the
public in a mountain town where I chiefly
reside, and yet is a private institution, receiving
no aid whatever from town or
state. And my message is to libraries of
small means and resources, so situated
that trained librarians or assistants are
not to be had.</p>

<p>We have by this time about 5,000 volumes,
all obtained through gift or pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>chase,
of which less than half are works of
fiction; and the list, on the whole, includes
most standard works. From one benefactor
we have a good stone building, erected
last year upon a lot of our own; and by
the time the testamentary provision of
another benefactor takes effect hereafter
we shall have an endowment fund ample
enough to place our institution upon a
permanent footing of liberal expenditure.
Hitherto our annual income has been
small and met by life memberships, special
entertainments and personal gifts, in
which summer visitors and the townspeople
combine.</p>

<p>In order that our books should be classified
but without too much effort I introduced,
some years ago, the following
scheme: A, denotes works of fiction; B,
biography, history, travels, etc.; C, poetry,
essays and miscellaneous; P, periodicals
and pamphlets (by bound volumes or in
cases); R, books of reference. Juvenile
books under these respective heads are
marked by an added J.</p>

<p>We have no card catalog and find our
patrons served more to their liking, and
perhaps more economically, by issuing
printed lists, frequently, which give the
author and the title simply; the number,
and letter, as printed, indicating the subject.
About 1905 a pamphlet catalog was
brought out which gave our list complete
to that date. Since that time, supplement
lists have been printed at convenience;
while the latest books are always posted
in the library on written sheets. When
the supplements become sufficiently numerous
we expect to issue a second full
pamphlet catalog; and so on. We cannot
pay for expert assistance to keep up a
card catalog properly, with our present
means; and what our patrons most want
is to have individual printed lists that
they can readily consult.</p>

<p>About 90 per cent of our circulation
consists of A or AJ books, but we try to
increase the demand for the B and C
books. So, too, the books most eagerly
sought are those last added, but we encourage
the reading of standard authors
wherever we may.</p>

<p>"Is the fiction circulated by our public
libraries helping to enlighten the people
on social and economic problems?"</p>

<p>George Meredith, in a letter written in
1884, said:</p>

<p>"I think that all right use of life, and
the one secret of life, is to pave ways for
the firmer footing of those who succeed
us.... Close knowledge of our fellows,
discernment of the laws of existence,
these lead to great civilization. I have
supposed that the novel, exposing and illustrating
the natural history of man, may
help us to such sustaining roadside gifts."</p>

<p>Merely "entertaining" fiction is comparable
to vaudeville or to tight-rope walking;
its use may be to amuse the tired laborer
of all sorts; its overuse, however, tends to
become a habit and produce flaccid minds.
Save for this, all fiction which depends on
"plot"&mdash;always a hash of used meats&mdash;or
on farcical or melodramatic "situation,"
is almost negligible. But on the whole,
and because of this flaccidity, I believe, it
would be a good thing if all merely "entertaining"
fiction could be destroyed.</p>

<p>A very small portion of that fiction
which is produced by artists seeking to
know and reveal life, deals with economic
problems. Except for the work of a few
writers (Mr. H. G. Wells, for instance,&mdash;he
includes economic discussions) it concerns
itself with social relations and "the
natural history of man." Its circulation
must certainly help to enlighten people
upon social problems. Here I must fail
you, for I do not know what type of fiction
has the circulation you mean; the most
general circulation, I take it. A novel is
helpful as it is a revelation of truth; it
is always harmful when it is written from
a false or assumed point-of-view; it is
very likely to be harmful when it is founded
upon shallow observation or a cocksure
philosophy. Most of the fiction produced
in our country today is founded upon
nothing except the desire to circulate;
therefore it shouldn't!</p>

<p>The question you ask is not debatable.
The public library is among the foremost
aids the American boy has today. As
great a help as the library is the librarian.
Much depends upon his personal interest,
enthusiasm, judgment, appreciation of the
book and the boy. "The man behind the
book," provides the power.</p>

<p>Librarians undoubtedly are a help not
only to the boy, but to the writer of boy's
books. But like all other classes there are
librarians and librarians. Some are efficient,
some too theoretical, some visionary,
some without the capacity to understand
the normal boy, and a few are deficient.
As far as I have observed, the limitations
of the librarians are not so much in their
knowledge of books as in their understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>ing
of boys. Every profession has its
special peril. The minister may become
dogmatic, the judge autocratic. The peril
of the purely bookish man is that of becoming
a prig. The pre-conceived opinion
of what a boy ought to be sometimes prevents
the discovery of what he really is.
Among some there is a tendency to magnify
the unusual boy at the expense of the
normal boy. Such librarians would confer
a benefit if they would discover what
has become of the prodigies of our boyhood.</p>

<p>It is sometimes forgotten that boys must
be led into better reading, not forcibly
transplanted. There are steps and stages
in this journey as in every other. A taste
for good reading is something to be cultivated,
not forced. A healthy boy has about
the same appetite for observing the ready-made
opinions of his superiors that he
has for donning the made-over garments
of his ancestors. Many librarians understand
the boy as well as the book. The
combination is fruitful, and divorce here
has its own penalty as well as elsewhere.
If the American boy (as in many places he
is) can be made to feel that the librarian
as well as the library are for his benefit,
a double good will result.</p>

</p>

<p>In reply to the question proposed to me
by your Association, "Is the public library
helping the boy to become a useful man?"
I reply emphatically in the affirmative. Of
course, the degree of helpfulness must
depend largely upon the library, and still
more upon the character of the boy. To
one of low tastes, with no ambition beyond
the hour's indulgence, the finest library
will have little meaning; but to one
having a thirst for knowledge, and aspirations
for self-improvement, access to any
fairly well chosen collection of books cannot
but prove of inestimable service in
stimulating and developing his nobler qualities.
My own early experience convinces
me of this. In my recollections of a backwoods
boyhood ("My Own Story," pages
44-46) I have told something of my indebtedness
of a small subscription library, in
which were found the works of a few great
writers, among those Byron, Shakespeare,
Plutarch, Cooper, and Scott, and a History
of England, which was the first book
I turned to after reading "Ivanhoe." The
world was transformed for me by the poets
and romancers that smiled on me from
those obscure shelves. I repeat here what
I once wrote of that golden opportunity of
my boyhood. The town has a vastly more
attractive and comprehensive library today;
but the value of such an institution
depends, after all, upon what we ourselves
bring to it. The few books that nourish
vitally the eager mind are better than
richly furnished alcoves amid which we
browse languidly and loiter with indifference.
This is true alike of the boy and
the man.</p>

<p>You ask, "Is the public library a factor
in the recent development of a public conscience?"</p>

<p>I suppose that by the term public conscience
you mean that undoubted quickening
of the public sense, shall we say public
decency?&mdash;which America has felt in the
last ten years, though as yet it has undertaken
no fundamental reforms, and is too
apt to degenerate into a mere hue and cry
after some individual whom it would make
a scape-goat for the sins of the people.</p>

<p>Now, in the development of this feeling,
or of this public conscience, it is doubtful
whether the public library has been
much of a factor. It depends altogether
upon the librarian. There are a few instances,
no doubt, in which the public library
has had this effect, and there are
many librarians in the country who, as
wise and intelligent men like yourself, are
interested in vital subjects, and therefore
able to interest others in them. By a judicious
exposure of books these subjects are
made so inviting and so attractive that
the patrons of the library are led on and
on in an ever widening exploration of the
subject. The library does offer to any one
who wishes to make inquiry the opportunity
of gratifying his desires, and in this
way it no doubt exercises a considerable
influence. There is a profound and tremendous
influence, silent and indirect,
from its mere existence, its mere presence,
which must do good in a city, just as in
a home in which there are many books,
even though they were never read, there
is the atmosphere of culture. The librarian,
however, should be a sort of teacher,
helping the public mind, assisting in the
development of the public conscience, for
I fear that the public, if left to themselves,
would rather read the six best sellers, and
in the realm of general ideas engage, to
recall a phrase of Henry James "in the
exercise of skipping."</p>

<h2>SECOND GENERAL SESSION<br />


(Tuesday morning, June 24, 1913)</h2>

<p>The PRESIDENT: We are to start this
morning with the committee reports. Unless,
however, undue objections are made
we shall read these by title and, like
the members of Congress, ask leave to
print. A number of them indeed are in
printed form and have been distributed
and you have doubtless found them on the
chairs as you entered the hall. I may say
that some of these reports are unusually
strong in that they represent the work of a
year of very careful thought and investigation
by their members. If you will take
the time, either at this conference or after
you get home, to read these reports, you
will greatly profit from the labors of these
respective committees. The printed reports
comprise those of the secretary, the
treasurer, the trustees of the endowment
fund, the publishing board, the committee
on bookbinding, the committee on bookbuying,
the committee on federal and state
relations; and reports have also been
received in manuscript, by the secretary,
from the committees on co-operation
with the National Education Association,
library administration, library training and
work with the blind. Unless it is requested
that any particular one of these reports
be read at this time we shall pass them
over and commit them to the secretary
for inclusion in the printed conference proceedings.</p>

<p>The above mentioned reports are here
printed in full.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>SECRETARY'S REPORT</h2>


<p>The third report of the present secretary
and the fourth since the establishment
of a headquarters office is here submitted
to the association. The material
conditions of headquarters are practically
identical with those reported a year ago;
we are still the recipients of the generosity
of the board of directors of the Chicago
public library, the large room furnished
free by them being more and more
appreciated as we compare our commodious
quarters with those greatly inferior
where a rent is charged which would be
prohibitive to the funds of the A. L. A.
For the continued courtesy and unfailing
kindness of the librarian of the Chicago
public library and his able staff I
cannot find adequate words. It is unquestionably
a decided advantage for the executive
office of the A. L. A. to be in close
proximity to a large reference collection
and to a competent corps of library experts.
In these respects we are fortunate
not only in the Chicago public library, but
also in the John Crerar and Newberry
libraries which so admirably supplement
each other in forming reference facilities
of a high order.</p>

<p>The routine work of the year has much
of it so closely resembled in kind that of
last year that the secretary feels it unnecessary
to rehearse it again in detail,
but respectfully refers inquiry on this
point to his report at the Ottawa conference.
In quantity it is rapidly increasing;
there are more letters to write; there is
more proof to read; more personal calls
from librarians and others as the establishment
of the office becomes known;
there are more arrangements to be made
for the many-sided interests of the Association.
The Publishing Board's work is
likewise increasing, and with the removal
of the Booklist office from Madison to
Chicago headquarters, which will be made
in the near future, additional duties will
devolve on the general office, even though
that periodical has its own special staff.
These things, however, are as we desire
they should be and we are pleased to see
indications that the funds of the Association
are going to permit the enlargement
of the work as this is found advisable.</p>

<p><b>The Office as an Information Bureau</b>&mdash;In
no way is this growth quite so noticeable
as in the increased correspondence
through which the executive office is used
as an information bureau on library economy.
For a time after the establishment
of the office this correspondence was
naturally almost entirely with librarians.
The letters of the past year, however, have
shown that our existence is becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
known to others. We are being told the
problems of the library committees of
women's clubs; of manufacturers who
wish to get their workmen interested in a
business library; of business men who are
thinking of establishing such a library; of
young men and women who are considering
librarianship as a vocation and do
not know the proper steps to take to get
the necessary training and experience;
and of publishers and of booksellers who
are referring various matters to our office.
These things in addition to the steady
daily stream of correspondence with librarians
in every state of the union. Last
year we recorded that our actual correspondence
averaged 67 letters a day for a
period covering several months. It has
been considerably greater the past year.
This includes, of course, all correspondence
relative to publications, membership
matters, and business routine. Several
months ago the secretary printed 10,000
little leaflets mentioning some of the ways
in which the A. L. A. can assist in library
informational lines. About half of these
have been distributed, mainly in channels
outside of regular library work and among
those who perhaps had not previously
learned of headquarters and of our publications.</p>

<p><b>Membership</b>&mdash;Last year it was the privilege
of the secretary to report that the
membership was larger than ever before
in the history of the Association. We are
now glad to be able to say that there is
a substantial increase in membership over
last year. In January, the secretary
mailed with the annual membership bills
an appeal to members to help again this
year as they did last in securing new
members. This appeal has been very effectual;
many have been instrumental in
securing one or more new members and
the secretary desires here to thank all
those who have so kindly assisted in this
campaign. During the late winter and
early spring many personal letters were
written to librarians and library boards
asking them to have their libraries become
institutional members of the A. L.
A., and many have responded favorably.
Several hundred personal letters were also
addressed to those who had recently, according
to the news columns in the library
periodicals, changed their positions,
presumably for the better financially.</p>

<p>When the last handbook was printed, in
October, 1912, there were 2,365 members
of the A. L. A. Since then to June 1st,
1913, 192 new individual members and
40 new institutional members have joined,
a total of 232. On the other hand, the
association has lost 11 members by death,
35 have resigned, and judging by the experience
of previous years about 160 members
will probably fail this year to renew
their membership and will consequently
be dropped from the rolls. It is likely that
enough new members will join at the
Kaaterskill Conference to offset in numbers
those whose membership lapses and
that the net membership in the 1913
handbook will probably be about 2,550 or a
gain of about 185 over 1912.</p>

<p>The income from membership dues is
in consequence steadily increasing. For
the calendar year 1911 the total amount
from this source was $5,325.46 (including
exchange on checks); in 1912, $6,236.18;
and for 1913 we hope the total amount will
not be far short of $7,000.</p>

<p><b>Publicity</b>&mdash;The usual methods to secure
as much publicity as possible have been
followed. The library periodicals have, of
course, been kept informed of what the
office was doing that would interest the
library public. We have sent news notes
from time to time to the Dial, Nation, New
York Times Review of Books, Bookman,
Education Review, American City, and
other magazines, and to about 180 of the
prominent newspapers of the country.
Several articles regarding the conference
were given to the Associated Press, and
to news syndicates. Before the Ottawa
Conference, the Associated Press sent to
all their subscribers a multi-graphed portion
of the president's address. The
Association needs more money for this
publicity work and more time should be
spent on it than the secretary has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
able to spend. Its results at present are
far from satisfactory and we hope that
with growth of income a more systematic
publicity department can be organized,
perhaps modelled somewhat after the excellent
methods employed by Prof. J. W.
Searson, who conducts the publicity work
of the National Education Association.</p>

<p><b>Registration for library position</b>&mdash;The
executive office has from its inception
been something of a free employment
bureau for librarians and library assistants,
who for proper and sufficient reasons
desire to change their positions.
This year the work has been somewhat
more systematized by the use of a printed
registration blank, which is sent on request
to any member of the association.
The questions asked on this blank are as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Date of this registration.</p>

<p>Name in full.</p>

<p>Address (permanent).</p>

<p>Address (temporary, or until ...).</p>

<p>State fully all schools (above grammar
grade) and colleges or universities you
have attended, with period of attendance
at each.</p>

<p>Degrees, when and where obtained.</p>

<p>Have you traveled abroad? When?
Where? How long?</p>

<p>Languages you read easily.</p>

<p>Languages you read with assistance of
a dictionary.</p>

<p>Library training and experience.</p>

<p>Positions held, with approximate dates;
and salary received.</p>

<p>Nature of appointment desired.</p>

<p>Salary expected.</p>

<p>Part of country preferred.</p>

<p>Physical condition.</p>

<p>References.</p></div>

<p>Forty-two librarians have thus far registered
on these blanks and five or six of
these have been helped to new positions.
The secretary has helped in the filling of
some fifteen library positions aside from
those using the registration blank.</p>

<p>If, however, the service to those seeking
positions, and to those seeking capable
librarians and assistants is to be as
important and far-reaching as we wish
to make it, the office must have knowledge
of vacancies as well as of persons wanting
positions. Library boards and librarians
are cordially invited to correspond with
the secretary when in need of library
workers.</p>

<p><b>Library Plans</b>&mdash;During the year a number
of valuable additions have been made
to our collection of architects' plans of
library buildings. We want more, particularly
good plans of buildings costing from
$25,000 to $75,000, as these are most in
demand. Will librarians and boards who
have recently acquired new buildings bear
our needs in mind? These plans have
from the beginning proved useful, and if
a fair number of the latest type of plans
could be added the collection would be
increasingly useful and used.</p>

<p><b>Library Pension Systems</b>&mdash;During the
year the secretary has been
making efforts to collect information
about pension systems in operation in libraries
or plans being made for pensions.
No great progress has been made, due
perhaps to the fact that not many libraries
are as yet contemplating a pension system.
The secretary will be glad to receive
information from any librarian or board
who has not yet written him on this
subject.</p>

<p><b>A. L. A. Representatives at State Meetings</b>&mdash;President
Legler was the official
representative at the Ohio meeting,
Newark, October 21-24; at the Illinois-Missouri
joint meeting, St. Louis, October
24-26; and South Dakota conference,
Mitchell, November 25-27. He also addressed
the Long Island Library Club on
the work of the A. L. A. on October 17th.</p>

<p>Mr. T. W. Koch, member of the Executive
Board, was the official representative
to the Indiana state meeting, Terre Haute,
October 17-19.</p>

<p>Dr. Arthur E. Bostwick, ex-president of
the A. L. A., represented the Association
at the North Dakota conference, Mayville,
October 1-2; Minnesota meeting, Faribault,
October 2-4; and Iowa meeting at
Nevada, October 8-10.</p>

<p>Secretary Utley represented the A. L.
A. at the Illinois-Missouri meeting, St.
Louis, October 24-26; Oklahoma meeting,
Muskogee, May 14-15; and was present un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>officially
at Niagara Falls, "New York library
week," September 23-28. The secretary
has also lectured before the New
York state library school, the Training
school for children's librarians of the
Pittsburgh Carnegie library, and the University
of Illinois library school.</p>

<p><b>Necrology.</b> The Association has lost by
death eleven members since the conference
of a year ago. The list includes an
ex-president of the A. L. A., and one of
the most prominent librarians of the
country; a business man who had for
years taken a deep interest in library
progress; an eminent churchman who has
for many years maintained his connection
with the national association; the librarian
of a large university; the librarian
of a well known public library; and
several others who at their several posts
have faithfully performed their duties and
rendered their contributions to the work
in which they were engaged.</p>

<p>The list follows:</p>

<p>Clarence W. Ayer, librarian of the Cambridge
(Mass.) public library, died April
12, 1913. He was previously connected
with Western Reserve University, but had
been engaged in library work in Massachusetts
for a number of years. He had
been a member of the A. L. A. since 1900
(No. 1984) and had attended four conferences.</p>

<p>Dr. John Shaw Billings, director of the
New York public library, died March 11,
1913. Successful as an army surgeon during
the war between the states, he later
assumed charge of the Surgeon-General's
library and brought it to recognition as
one of the most celebrated medical libraries
in the world, and compiled an
index catalog that has taken a place
among the permanent monuments of bibliography.
Coming to New York in 1895, he
began the stupendous work of bringing
the various libraries of that city under
one great system, releasing funds tied by
legal complications, and superintending
the erection of a central building costing
nearly ten millions of dollars. These
tasks he lived to accomplish and they remain
as his lasting monument. He was
president of the A. L. A. for the year
1901-02, and presided at its Magnolia conference.
He joined the association in
1881 (No. 404) and attended six of its
conferences. See Public Libraries, 18:
148-9; Library Journal, 38, 212-14.</p>

<p>Bertha Coit, assistant in the New York
public library, died July 22, 1912. She
joined the Association in 1904 (No. 3167),
and attended the conferences of 1904 and
1907.</p>

<p>Right Rev. William Croswell Doane,
Bishop of Albany, and for many years
vice-chancellor of the University of the
State of New York, died May 16, 1913. He
joined the A. L. A. in 1893 (No. 1125) and
although he attended none of the conferences
had steadily maintained his interest
in library work and retained his membership
in the Association.</p>

<p>Jennie S. Irwin, first assistant in the
Mt. Vernon (N. Y.) public library, died
Nov. 8, 1912. She joined the Association in
1902 (No. 2437) and attended the conferences
of 1906 and 1908.</p>

<p>Walter Kendall Jewett, librarian of the
University of Nebraska, since 1906, died
March 3, 1913. He was previously librarian
of the medical department of the John
Crerar library, and had been notably successful
in his library work. He joined the
Association in 1904 (No. 3109) and attended
four conferences.</p>

<p>Charles A. Larson, editor of publications
of the Chicago public library, died August
19, 1912. He had been connected with the
Chicago library for many years and was
highly valued. His able work in the reference
department will be long remembered.
He joined the Association in 1901
(No. 2373) and after lapsing membership
rejoined in 1910. He attended the Mackinac
conference.</p>

<p>Rev. William Ladd Ropes, librarian-emeritus
of the Andover Theological Seminary,
at Andover, Massachusetts, died
December 24, 1912. He was well known
to the librarians of an earlier generation.
He joined the A. L. A. in 1877 (No. 106)
and attended three A. L. A. conferences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and the London international conference
of 1877.</p>

<p>Charles Carroll Soule, of Boston, long
identified with the book publishing business
and interested in library work, died
Jan. 7, 1913. He was trustee of the Brookline
(Mass.) public library from 1889-1899,
member of the A. L. A. Publishing Board
from 1890-1908, second vice-president of
the A. L. A. in 1890; and a member of the
Council 1893-96 and 1900-05. Mr. Soule was
an expert on library planning, having written
a book, and numerous articles on this
subject. A pamphlet on "Library rooms
and buildings" was issued by the A. L. A.
Publishing Board as one of its tracts. He
joined the A. L. A. in 1879 (No. 216) and
had attended 18 conferences. No librarian
was better known to librarians than this
interested layman. See Library Journal,
38:89; Public Libraries, 18:57.</p>

<p>Nelson Taylor, bookseller of New York,
of the firm of Baker &amp; Taylor, died June
26, 1912. He had been a member of the
A. L. A. since 1906 (No. 3531).</p>

<p>Bertha S. Wildman, secretary to the
librarian of the Carnegie library of Pittsburgh
and a member of the faculty of the
Training school for children's librarians,
died February 19, 1913. She was a graduate
of Pratt Institute library school and
previous to her connection with the Pittsburgh
library had been the organizer and
first librarian of the Madison (N. J.) public
library. She joined the A. L. A. in 1900
(No. 1945) and attended four conferences.</p>

<h2>REPORT OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE</h2>


<p>To the American Library Association:
Ladies and Gentlemen:&mdash;</p>

<p>In accordance with the provisions of the
constitution, the Finance Committee submit
the following report:&mdash;</p>

<p>They have duly considered the probable
income of the Association for the current
year and have estimated it at $21,915.00,
and have approved appropriations made by
the Executive Board to that amount. The
details of the estimated income and of
the appropriations are given in the January
number of the Bulletin. The committee
have also approved the appropriation
to the use of the Publishing Board of any
excess of sales over the amount estimated.</p>

<p>On behalf of the committee, the chairman
has audited the accounts of the treasurer
and of the secretary as assistant
treasurer. He has found that the receipts
as stated by the treasurer agree with the
transfer checks from the assistant treasurer,
and with the cash accounts of the latter.
The expenditures as stated are accounted
for by properly approved vouchers.
The bank balance and petty cash, as
stated, agree with the bank books and petty
cash balances. The accounts of the assistant
treasurer have been found correct
as cash accounts.</p>

<p>On behalf of the committee, Mr. E. H.
Anderson has checked the securities now
in the custody of the trustees, and certifies
that their figures in regard to the securities
on hand are correct. He finds that
at par value the bonds and other securities
amount to $102,500.00 for the Carnegie
fund, and $7,000.00 for the principal account.
He certifies that to the best of his
knowledge and belief the accounts submitted
are correct.</p>

<p>All of which is respectively submitted
for the committee.</p>

<p>With the completion of the ninth volume
of the A. L. A. Booklist Miss Elva
L. Bascom severs her connection as editor
and as head of the editorial department of
the Publishing Board. For five years Miss
Bascom has carried on this work with signal
ability and with devoted industry, and
it is with sincere regret that the members
of the Board have accepted her resignation.
During this period of editorial activity
Miss Bascom has maintained the excellent
standards established by her predecessors,
Miss Caroline Garland and Mrs.
Katharine MacDonald Jones, and has
given to the publication a standard of
judgment in selection and critical appreciation
that has made the A. L. A. Booklist
invaluable to thousands of librarians
and as many library trustees in the selection
of current books for their respective
institutions. The A. L. A. Booklist is
everywhere recognized as a publication
wholly untrammeled by commercial consideration
in the listing of books and the
recommendation which these are given.</p>

<p>Miss May Massee has been elected as
Miss Bascom's successor and will enter
upon the work early in August. Her experience
as a member of the staff of the
Buffalo public library and her training
prior thereto commends her for the position.</p>

<p>Concerning the A. L. A. Booklist there
are no new facts to report, comments
noted in previous reports being applicable
as well at this time. While renewed representations
have come to the members
of the Board, suggesting a change of size,
form, and character, and the arguments in
behalf thereof have been given due
weight, it has not seemed wise to alter the
policy which has been continued for a
period of nine years.</p>

<p>With the beginning of the new volume
the place of publication and therewith the
editorial headquarters will be transferred
from Madison, Wis., to Chicago. By consolidating
the editorial headquarters of
the Publishing Board with the headquarters
of the American Library Association
both will be materially strengthened and
some financial economies can be affected.</p>

<p><b>Periodical Cards</b>&mdash;The Board received
word last fall from the Library Bureau
that they would have to advance prices
for the printing of the analytical periodical
cards. The matter was placed in the
hands of a committee, and after some negotiation,
unexpectedly prolonged by the
illness of the representative of the Library
Bureau, a rearrangement of the
work was made which will enable the
Board to continue the service to the present
subscribers without change in prices.
This has been accomplished by giving an
order for sixty-five copies of all titles and
thirty-five additional titles of the periodicals
most in demand. Hereafter, subscriptions
must be made either to the full set
of approximately 2500 titles, or to the limited
set of 200. A revision of the list is
now in progress.</p>

<p>Concerning the periodicals issued during
the past year Mr. William Stetson Merrill
has submitted the following report as
editor:</p>

<p>The sixteen shipments of A. L. A. periodical
cards prepared and sent out during
the year ending May 31, 1913 have
comprised those numbered 284 to 299,
which were received by subscribers June
18, 1912 to May 14, 1913. These shipments
have included 3459 new titles and
136 reprints, making a total of 3595 titles.
The time of preparation has been reduced
from thirteen to ten and a half weeks.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> By "time of preparation" is here meant the interval
between the receipt of copy, and receipt of
cards by the subscribers.</p></div>

<p>In February of the present year the editor
took occasion to check up the work
currently done, with the titles of periodicals
given in the printed list as indexed
by the Publishing Board. It was then discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
that in the case of thirty-five periodicals
no titles had been indexed during
intervals ranging from two to five years
to date. These facts were brought to the
attention of the collaborating libraries,
which later reported upon these arrears as
follows: Periodicals for which no issues
later than those indexed had been received
by the library, 12; discontinued, 3;
now indexed by the Library of Congress,
2; overlooked or indexing postponed by
the library, 10; dropped, 2; record card
wrong, 1; no indexer, 5. The collaborating
libraries at once took up the work
of bringing their indexing up to date and
at the time of writing only three current
periodicals are not indexed to date, with
the exception of those for which there is
at present no indexer.</p>

<p>The preparation of the distribution and
charges sheets has been in the hands of
Mrs. S. L. Hitz and Miss Jane Burt under
the supervision of the editor, who has also
attended to all the correspondence connected
with the card work.</p>

(Handbook 7). (1000 copies).</p></div>

<p><b>A. L. A. Catalog</b>&mdash;The success of the A.
L. A. Catalog, 1904-11, has been greater
in point of sales than the most sanguine
of us had expected, 3471 copies having
been sold since its publication a year ago.
There is still a reasonably steady demand,
321 copies having been sold during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
first five months of 1913. The book has
been more extensively advertised than any
of the Board's other recent publications,
special efforts having been made to make
it known to high schools, college professors
and book lovers generally, but the
sales have, nevertheless, been largely confined
to libraries, library commissions and
library schools.</p>

<p><b>Manual of Library Economy</b>&mdash;Fourteen
chapters of the Manual have thus far been
printed, each as a separate pamphlet, and
one is now in press. The list is as follows:</p>

<p>1. American library history, by C. K.
Bolton.</p>

<p>2. The Library of Congress, by W. W.
Bishop.</p>

<p>4. The college and university library,
by J. I. Wyer, Jr.</p>

<p>5. Proprietary and subscription libraries,
by C. K. Bolton.</p>

<p>9. Library legislation, by W. F. Yust.</p>

<p>10. The library building, by W. R.
Eastman.</p>

<p>12. Administration of a public library,
by A. E. Bostwick.</p>

<p>13. Training for librarianship, by Mary
W. Plummer.</p>

<p>15. Branch libraries and other distributing
agencies, by Linda A. Eastman.</p>

<p>17. Order and accession department,
by F. F. Hopper.</p>

<p>20. Shelf department, by Josephine A.
Rathbone.</p>

<p>22. Reference department, by E. C.
Richardson.</p>

<p>26. Bookbinding, by A. L. Bailey.</p>

<p>27. Commissions, state aid and state
agencies, by Asa Wynkoop. In press.</p>

<p>32. Library printing, by F. K. Walter.</p>

<p>The chairman of the Committee the manual,
J. I. Wyer, Jr., reports that seven
other chapters are known to be in an advanced
state and may be expected soon.</p>

<p><b>Advertising</b>&mdash;The Board's publications
have as usual been advertised in Library
Journal and Public Libraries and in one
or two special numbers of the Dial. Review
copies of publications are sent to library
periodicals and a number of other
papers and magazines, such as the Bookman,
American City, Nation, Dial, New
York Times Review, Chicago Post (Friday
review), Springfield Republican, Boston
Transcript, etc. Our best returns, however,
continue to come from direct circularization
of libraries, library commissions
and library schools, about 11,000 pieces of
mail advertising our publications having
been sent out since the last conference.</p>

<p>No new large publication has appeared
since the A. L. A. Catalog, 1904-11, was
published a year ago. Although thirteen
new publications have been printed and
two more are forthcoming they are all,
with one exception, small in size and with
price ranging from ten to twenty-five cents
a copy. Consequently the amounts from
sales are but small in the aggregate.
Would it not be well for the Board to endeavor
to put forth at least one publication
each year which shall be of sufficient
size, usefulness and importance to make
it rank as the "opus major" of the year?
There are surely subjects enough within
our scope that can be handled to the advantage
of the libraries and the profit of
the Board.</p>

<p><b>Foreign lists</b>&mdash;The Board has not felt
greatly encouraged to undertake the publication
of lists of foreign books because
of the unfortunate financial experience
with those already issued, only one
of the five having paid for itself. This
spring, however, when the manuscript of
the long-expected Polish list was received
a new policy was adopted. The secretary
circularized those libraries whom he
thought would be interested in this list,
stating that the publication of the list
depended upon the receipt of a sufficient
number of subscriptions, requesting those
libraries who were able and disposed to do
so, to subscribe for at least four copies at
25 cents each. By this means enough subscriptions
were readily secured and the
Polish list has been printed. If libraries
are willing to subsidize the publication of
these lists, or putting it another way, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
pay for several copies more than they perhaps
need, other lists can be undertaken,
and the Board will welcome suggestions
as to what languages should be taken up.
It has been suggested that a Yiddish list
would be useful, also Italian, Lithuanian,
Finnish and Spanish lists.</p>

<h2>REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE CARNEGIE AND
ENDOWMENT FUNDS</h2>


<p>To the President and Members of the
American Library Association:</p>

<p>The Trustees of the Endowment Fund
of the American Library Association beg
leave to submit the following statement
of the accounts of their trust&mdash;the Carnegie
and General Funds&mdash;for the fiscal year
ending January 15, 1913.</p>

<p>There has been no change in the investments,
and all interest has been promptly
paid. The Trustees are pleased to call
attention to the credit to the General Endowment
Fund of nine life memberships,
and would recommend that more of such
memberships be taken as they are about
the only source of addition to that Fund.</p>

<p>On January 31, 1913, the usual audit of
the investments and accounts of the trust
was made by Mr. E. H. Anderson, of the
New York public library at the request of
the chairman of the Finance committee of
the Association. As evidence of the audit,
Mr. Anderson furnished the Trustees with
the following copy of his report made to
the Finance committee:</p>

<p class="right">Feb. 1, 1913.</p>

<p>
My dear Mr. Andrews:<br />
</p>

<p>Yesterday, January 31st, I went to the
vaults of the Union Trust Company at
Fifth avenue and Thirty-eighth street, this
city, and with Mr. Appleton and Mr. Kimball,
trustees of the endowment fund of
the American Library Association, checked
up the bonds now in their custody. I enclose
herewith their typewritten statement
concerning the funds in their hands,
and I certify to the correctness of the
figures as to the bonds on hand. These I
have checked in black ink after a personal
count of them at the vaults aforesaid. At
their par value they amount to $102,500 for
the Carnegie Fund, and $7,000 for the general
endowment fund.</p>

<p>I have not examined the bank book of
the trustees nor the vouchers for the
amounts transmitted to Mr. Roden, the
treasurer. Mr. Roden's records should
verify the amounts transmitted to the
treasurer. If you think it worth while I
can examine the bank book of the
trustees, but personally I do not think it
necessary. If you feel that it should be
done, however, return the enclosed typewritten
statement for comparison with the
bank book. Mr. Roden will also be able
to check the receipts for life members. I
think Mr. Appleton said that two more
had been received since January 15th.</p>

<p>I hereby certify that to the best of my
knowledge and belief all of the accounts
on the typewritten sheets enclosed herewith
are correct.</p>

<p class="center">Very sincerely yours,
</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 23.5em;">(Signed) E. H. ANDERSON.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 23.5em;">Respectfully submitted,</span><br />

<h2>BOOKBINDING COMMITTEE</h2>


<p>In last year's report it was stated
that a special collection, showing the kind
of work done by library binders, had been
started by this committee. During the
past year this collection has been materially
increased by samples submitted by
different binders; it now includes work
from 34 binders covering the entire country
from the Atlantic ocean to the Pacific.
The collection was formed so that
when librarians write to ask about the
work of specific binders, the work itself
can be examined and intelligent answers
given.</p>

<p>Notices of the collection were printed
in the various library periodicals and a
certain numbers of requests for information
have been received; a smaller number
than the committee hoped for, but sufficient
to warrant keeping the collection
up-to-date.</p>

<p>In view of certain criticisms of this collection,
it may be well to state that it is
not the purpose to print criticisms of the
work of different binders, or to grade
them in any way. When asked for information
the committee will not compare
the work of one binder with another,
neither will librarians be advised to desert
one binder and employ another. All that
will be done will be to send suggestions
as to ways in which the work of the binder
in question can be improved. In order
to do this the work of the binder must be
available for examination. The committee
fails to see how any binder can take
offense at this method, or claim that other
binders are being officially recognized by
the A. L. A.</p>

<p>The announcement of the publishers of
the Encyclopaedia Britannica that they
were about to issue a Yearbook which
would be printed only on India paper
called forth a protest from this committee
against the use of thin paper&mdash;a protest
which had no effect whatever until letters
protesting against its use had been sent
to the publishers by 50 librarians of the
larger libraries. Even then the sole concession
that the publishers made was to
agree to bind 750 copies on ordinary paper,
provided that we could guarantee a
sale of that number. For this reason the
committee asks that those who wish to
purchase a thick paper edition of the Yearbook
register their orders with the committee.
If the total number by July 1st
amounts to 750 copies, the publishers will
be notified to that effect. Many librarians
have refused to buy the India paper edi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>tion,
and it is evident that if all librarians
would refuse to get it, the publishers would
realize that the demands of librarians in
this respect should be heeded.</p>

<p>There have been comparatively few
reference books published or announced
during the year which the committee felt
would need to be bound especially for library
use. It was thought advisable, however,
to submit our specifications for binding
the new editions of the Standard Dictionary
and Appleton's Cyclopaedia of
American Biography. The publishers of
the Standard Dictionary adopted practically
all of the specifications and the publishers
of the Cyclopaedia of American Biography
now have them under consideration.</p>

<p>In this connection it is worthy of notice
that the publishers of reference books are
not only giving studied attention to binding
processes, but they also realize more
fully than they did a few years ago the
necessity of using leather which is free-from-acid.
Until within the last two or
three years it has been difficult to get
leathers tanned according to the specifications
of the Society of Arts. Recently,
however, several firms in this country
have begun to specialize in leathers free-from-acid;
and in addition to this, the
Government Printing Office insists on having
a certain amount of such leather and
calls for it in its proposals for bids. These
are encouraging signs that in the future
we may hope to get leather which will
not disintegrate so rapidly as that which
we have been obliged to use for many
years past.</p>

<p>With assured standards of book cloths
and leathers, which manufacturers, publishers,
binders and librarians each year
are recognizing more and more as vital to
the proper construction of a serviceable
book, there remains only paper to be carefully
standardized. Some efforts are being
made by private companies and by the
government to discover which papers are
best for certain uses, but at present the librarian
at least knows little of the subject
and is practically at the mercy of the
publisher.</p>

<h2>COMMITTEE ON BOOKBUYING</h2>


<p>At the Ottawa meeting of the American
Library Association this committee reported
simply progress, without giving details
of its work during the past year, but
it had submitted the following report to
the Executive Board, which we now submit
to the Association at large, and follow
it up with a further report of the
action of your committee during the past
year.</p>

<p>To the Executive Board of the American
Library Association.</p>

<p>The A. L. A. Committee on bookbuying
met with a committee from the American
Booksellers' Association in Cleveland on
May 13, 1912 for the purpose of discussing
book prices and discounts to libraries. As
it was found impossible to come to any
satisfactory understanding before the annual
meeting of the associations, it was
decided to make only a report of progress.
It was, however, further agreed that a
more detailed report should be made to
the Executive Boards of the associations
to ascertain if the Executive Boards
deemed it wise that the discussion should
be continued.</p>

<p>The Booksellers' Association at its annual
convention held in New York in May
has accepted the report of progress, and
has reappointed its committee.</p>

<p>During the year 1910-11 your committee
had much correspondence with the officers
of the American Booksellers' Association,
with the librarians and with the
booksellers throughout the country on
questions of the upward tendency of book
prices and the efforts which were being
made to decrease the discounts to libraries.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the American Booksellers'
Association held in May, 1911, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
committee on "Relations with libraries"
was appointed to take up the matter with
the committee of the A. L. A. Shortly
after this committee was appointed, your
committee asked that a time be set for
a meeting. As the chairman of the Booksellers'
committee was abroad, the matter
was postponed until September. In
September the A. L. A. committee was
asked to prepare a statement and submit
it to the committee of the American
Booksellers' Association, to which they
agreed to make a reply, the two papers
to form the basis for a discussion at a
meeting to be held as soon as the Booksellers'
reply had been prepared. We
submitted the statement requested in
October, 1911. Although repeated requests
for a reply were made, we did not succeed
in getting a copy until March, 1912,
and notwithstanding repeated requests for
a meeting to discuss the matter, none was
held until May 13, 1912, on the eve of
the annual conference of the American
Booksellers' Association.</p>

<p>We attach a copy of the statement made
by your committee and the reply by the
committee of the American Booksellers'
Association. The attitude of the members
of the committee of the Booksellers'
Association at the meeting referred to did
not differ from that taken in the reply
excepting that they were willing to modify
the expressions in the reply to a considerable
degree. It urged that special attention
should be given to the tables of business
loss and profit, which had been prepared
in the book store of Brentano's. In
connection with these figures the net
books should be most considered so far as
the new books are concerned. At the
present rate of increase of books so issued
it will be but a short time before all
books are so published.</p>

<p>Your committee was asked to admit that
it was morally wrong to demand that the
booksellers should do business at any such
profits, or loss, shown by these figures.
Your committee did not feel that it was
justified in taking that position, nor
would it be even if it were more certain
of the accuracy and fairness of the figures.</p>

<p>Without doubt there is much that is
wrongfully asked or required of the booksellers
by some of the library people,
which must of necessity add materially to
the cost of doing business, but this, we
believe, should be paid for by those asking
the special favors, and should not be
covered by a regular charge upon all library
business. There was much to be
said in favor of the booksellers' increase
of prices if it needs to cover such expenses.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is thought that
the bookseller is not justified in all of the
increases which have been made in the
prices of books to libraries; as, for example,
the discounts now allowed to libraries
from prices of the net fiction and
net juveniles.</p>

<p>It is believed that, with the right spirit
of co&ouml;peration, there are certain changes
that might be made which would help the
bookseller, as well as the librarian. If
what we understand to be the present attitude
of the booksellers remains unchanged,
if they are unable to give as well
as to take, your committee feels as though
the discussion might as well come to an
end. We believe that there exists considerable
difference of opinion among booksellers
as to the justice of the terms now
being offered to libraries as large buyers
of books.</p>

<p>It will be a matter of great regret if
there cannot be established most cordial
relations between the libraries and the
Booksellers' Association. At the same time,
we do not think that the A. L. A. should
establish such relations upon terms made
wholly for the benefit of the booksellers.</p>

<p>We think that the Executive Board
should know the present condition of the
negotiations, so that it might, if it sees
fit, instruct its future committee.</p>

<p>Statement Made by the Committee on
Bookbuying of the American Library
Association to the Committee on
Relations with Libraries of
the American Booksellers'
Association.</p>

<p>October, 1911.</p>

<p>To the Committee on Relations with Libraries,
American Booksellers' Association.</p>

<p>Gentlemen:</p>

<p>We send you herewith a brief statement
of the position of the Book Buying
Committee of the American Library Association
in relation to the subject which
we hope to discuss with you.</p>

<p>The relations between libraries and the
book trade should be placed upon a business
basis, and the discussion of them upon
any other ground is not asked for by
the libraries.</p>

<p>There is no question as to the desirability
and the necessity of improving the
conditions of the book trade, and we are
in sympathy with the apparently successful
efforts now being made toward that
end.</p>

<p>The libraries ask that at this time of
reorganization and radical changes a careful
and just consideration should be given
to their claims as large buyers of a special
character. This has always been recognized
in the past, and is the reason for
the special discounts allowed them by the
booksellers.</p>

<p>The library trade as a factor in the
book business is of increasing importance.
While it may not be considered as "Wholesale
business" if, as it is claimed, that
term implies the purchase in quantities
of single titles and involves a business
risk in such purchases, yet it differs so
much more from the character of the retail
trade that in the new adjustment of
discounts there would seem to be little
justice in charging against it the expenses
of retail trade.</p>

<p>We believe that the amount of library
trade, and its peculiar character warrant
your association in having appointed a
committee to consider its claims.</p>

<p>In dealing with libraries many of the
largest items of the expense involved in
the conduct of the retail business are
wholly unnecessary. It can be conducted
as well by dealers on back streets or in
lofts as it can be by those who have the
most luxurious and expensive stores to
attract the retail trade, it does not call
for the advertising of their wares by the
dealers; all skill of salesmanship is eliminated,
and no accounts have to be
charged off because of failure.</p>

<p>It is claimed that there are other expenses
as great, perhaps, as those mentioned,
which are peculiar to the library
trade, but in reality are not called for in
the business of many libraries, and while,
perhaps, they are customary, they are
really necessary in but few cases, if any.
These expenses would seem to be rather
the result of bookselling methods than
because of any peculiar demands of the
business. These "bad features," as they
were called in your recent convention,
were pointed out as being</p>

<p>(a) Very slow pay,</p>

<p>(b) Its approval feature,</p>

<p>(c) The practice of asking for competitive
bids with the lack of ability to judge
squarely of such bids.</p>

<p>We cannot see that any of these features
are of vital importance to the library.
To many libraries, as we have said, they
do not apply at all, and probably others
would be better off if they were not allowed
by the trade.</p>

<p>The "approval feature" which was made
much of by one of your officers, is, we
believe, quite as much the fault of the
dealers who wish to urge the sale of their
stock as it is the fault of libraries who
wish to examine the books before purchasing.
Many books are sent out to libraries
on approval which have already been
passed upon, or are entirely outside the
range of their purchase, and involve an
expense of time to the library, which is
forced upon it by the bookseller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>We agree that no library should ask
for competitive bids on itemized lists, for
the gain to the libraries who do this is
much smaller than the expense involved.
It is probable that such lists would show
a lack of bibliographical detail and would
require much time in wasted effort on the
part of the bookseller. Library authorities
purchasing books in this manner might,
perhaps, be expected to show a "lack of
ability to judge squarely of such bids."
We believe that the bibliographical work
of the bookseller in searching for the best
(or more often the cheapest) edition to
quote on such a list is the most expensive
work the bookseller would have in this
trade. Such work is wholly unnecessary, as
the selected lists of recommended books
published by the American Library Association,
as well as those published by the
state and local associations and the large
libraries, are in the habit of stating the
edition, the publisher's name and the
price. It is safe to say that all libraries
are supplied with such bibliographical aid
to the extent of their needs and purchases.</p>

<p>This question, however, has little to
do with the trade of the libraries conducted
according to modern methods. The
best libraries do not send out for competitive
bids on itemized orders, and they do
place the necessary bibliographical detail
on their orders, and we might add that
their officers are fully capable of judging
squarely the editions supplied and the
price quoted.</p>

<p>We should like to see the book trade
classify the library business as peculiar to
itself. Taking the best library trade as a
standard, it might suggest some requirements
which should be asked for in return
for obtaining the library discount.
If the business is free from these faults
with which it is more or less justly
charged, it should be profitable to the
bookseller.</p>

<p>We believe that libraries have a right
to protest against the increasing charges
made to them for the passing of the books
of the publishers through the hands of
the booksellers, and that some concessions
should be made in the discounts now
granted. We believe that there is ample
room for increasing the booksellers' profits
by the reformation of its methods, or perhaps
we should say the library methods,
which are now accepted by them. The
general increase and the tendency toward
further increases in the charges for the
handling of books for libraries by the rules
of your association we believe to be unjust,
and that we are fully justified in
asking that a careful consideration be given
to this question with a view toward
making more liberal discounts to this
trade.</p>

<p>We do not believe that the last move
of your association in making the same
discount on net fiction as upon other net
books is warranted, for we think it would
be only fair to grant the libraries a proportion
of the larger profit which the bookseller
receives by reason of the extra discount
allowed by the publishers on net
fiction. If no other concession is made,
we believe that a better price should be
offered to libraries on their purchases of
net fiction.</p>

<p>We should regret to have the booksellers
take action which would give the libraries
the impression that their trade
was a burden to the booksellers; that the
members of your association required a
larger profit from them than what is
amply satisfactory to the jobbing trade
and many dealers.</p>

<p>It is to the interests of the library to
foster friendly relations with the local
booksellers. We believe that together
they can be of more service than when
working against each other; it is good
for the community; we believe that it is
also to the interests of the booksellers to
keep the library trade, not only because of
sentimental reasons, but because it pays.
Not only are the library accounts practically
guaranteed and the requirements of
display, advertising and salesmanship minimized,
as we have already stated, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
library is often the only buyer of many
books which are received by the booksellers.
No other one customer keeps the
stock moving to such an extent as the library.
None other wears out books and
calls for so many duplications after the
period of popular demand, taking from
the bookseller's shelves books which he
need not re-stock. Much of this kind of
trade prevents actual loss which the bookseller
would have without the library customer.</p>

<p>We are not at all convinced that the
booksellers are losers in the library trade,
nor do we wish to be placed in the position
of receiving special favors. The libraries
like to feel that the booksellers
are giving them fair prices so they will
not be constantly shown by out-of-town
dealers how much cheaper they might
have bought their new books by waiting a
brief time after publication.</p>

<p>Wide margins of profit always lead to
the cutting of prices unless the trade is
absolutely controlled, which is not the
condition in the book trade at this time.</p>

<p>We wish to be in a position to urge all
libraries to buy of the regular dealers in
their localities, and trust that your committee
may be able to see some way of
recommending further concessions to the
library trade.</p>


<h3>Answer to the Foregoing Statement</h3>

<p>Answer to the library Committee on Relation
with Booksellers, as proposed by
Charles E. Butler, Brentano's, New York.</p>

<p>1. We agree that the relations between
librarians and booksellers should be on a
business basis, and that there is no question
as to the desirability of improving the
condition of the book trade.</p>

<p>2. We are in hearty sympathy with the
desire of the libraries, that a careful and
just consideration should be given to their
claims for better discount as large buyers
collectively of a special character.</p>

<p>3. It is the most earnest desire of the
book trade to be absolutely fair and just
toward the libraries. We fully and most
sincerely believe that the libraries would
not for a moment desire or expect that
their purchases should be made at the
sacrifice of a trade, whose very existence
depends on what reasonable profit can be
made by them in their business transactions.</p>

<p>4. The libraries believe that the booksellers
can make better discounts than
they do now, if they carry on their business
along the lines indicated by them,
while the booksellers claim that the present
condition of buying and selling prohibits
them from making a profit, but is
actually productive of loss, and that the
method proposed by the libraries is not
possible.</p>

<p>5. The booksellers are of necessity the
agent of the publisher. If his business is
not self-sustaining, he must fail. The reduction
of real booksellers, by a most liberal
construction of what constitutes a bookseller,
from about 3,000 when our population
was 40 millions to about 2,000 with
our population at 90 millions, is evidence
of the truth of this assertion. The booksellers
are entitled to sell to everyone who
buys books, libraries or others.</p>

<p>6. The libraries are not booksellers,
therefore they are not entitled to booksellers'
discounts, which they are now getting
from certain sources. Thus, booksellers
are deprived of the library business.</p>

<p>7. The bookseller is an important factor
in any community in which he is
placed. He is taxed by city and state.
His educational influence cannot be estimated.
His capital, his brains and physical
effort are all invested in making his
business a success. To do so, he needs
reasonable profits, and it is business folly
to do any part of his business that results
in a loss.</p>

<p>8. A great majority of the libraries are
created and supported by direct taxation,
by charitable contribution, endowment,
legacies and the like. It is true, the libraries
have to be conducted in a careful,
businesslike way simply keeping within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
their means. Doing this, they are free
from the booksellers' anxieties and difficulties
as a merchant.</p>

<p>9. The unique position enjoyed by libraries
in the community as to their capital
and freedom from commercial risk, and
exemption from taxation and rent, has
raised the question: "Why should they receive
discounts on books?" Do they, as
libraries, get special discounts on their
building, their shelving, light, heat, electricity
and supplies, etc., etc.?</p>

<p>10. The libraries state that in booksellers
dealing with libraries many of the
largest items of the expense involved in
the conduct of the retail business are
wholly unnecessary.</p>

<p>"It can be conducted as well by dealers
on <b>back streets or in lofts</b> as it can be
done by those who have the most luxurious
stores to attract the retail trade; it
does not call for the advertising of their
wares by the dealer; all skill of salesmanship
is eliminated and no accounts have to
be charged off because of failure."</p>

<p>11. The bookseller establishes himself
in every community, in such locations as
will attract trade&mdash;generally the best&mdash;limited
only by his capacity to pay rent
and expenses. This is vital to his success.
A bookseller locating himself on a
<b>back street</b> for the purpose of doing business
to enable him to give the library a
large portion of his small earnings would
speedily end his career. He could not get
enough library business to exist on and his
chances of doing a general retail business,
on a back street, would be very small indeed.
He would become solely a 25 per
cent or 30 per cent buyer, 10 per cent
which he gives to the libraries, with a possible
28, 25 or 20 per cent expense account.
We do not believe that the libraries would
knowingly ask anyone to do business under
such circumstances for their benefit.
Will the libraries figure this out?</p>

<p>12. Presuming, for the sake of argument,
a bookseller does locate himself on
a back street for the purpose of doing library
business: He <b>must</b> be a bookseller
to get a <b>wholesale rate</b>. A mere agent
not carrying stock, but simply buying on
orders, would not be supported or supplied
by the publishers, as he does not carry
stock or assume the risk of the business.</p>

<p>13. He would therefore have to carry a
reasonable amount of stock to be considered
a bookseller. The libraries may not
know that the discount given the bookseller
is qualified by the quantity purchased
of each item. Thus, the average
trade discount now prevailing on net
books and net fiction is 30 per cent in
small quantities. If he purchases 10 to 25
copies of a title, he gets an extra 5 per
cent. If he purchases 50 to 250 of a title
(according to the publisher and the book
offered) he gets an extra 10 per cent. The
libraries familiar with this discount, and
being misguided as to the results, argue
that a better discount than they now get
should be given them by the bookseller.
We have not included here the great number
of books published at such discounts
as 25 per cent, 20 per cent, 15 per cent,
and even 10 per cent, to which must be
added transportation and other charges.
More of such books are bought by libraries
than by the retail buyer, such as
educational books, scientific books, medical
books, law books, subscription books,
etc.</p>

<p>14. Now this is what really happens to
the man on the <b>back street</b>, as well as to
<b>the bookseller</b> on the principal thoroughfare.
It is safe to say that out of the purchase
of 100 new books of any one house,
say for a period of a year, about 90 per
cent would have to be bought in small
quantities at a discount of 30 per cent,
about 5 per cent at the extra 5 per cent
discounts, and 5 per cent at the extra 10
per cent discounts. Thus, buying 90 per
cent of his stock at 30 per cent and selling
to libraries at a discount of 10 per cent
leaves 20 per cent to do business, with
an average expense cost to the bookseller
of 28 per cent on every dollar of sale. <b>The
10 per cent at better rate would improve
matters very little</b>, as can readily be seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
It does not seem as if the bookseller could
make better discount than he does to the
libraries and it really is a question
whether he is justified in giving as much
as he does now, if able to give any at all,
except at a loss to him.</p>

<p>15. The theory has been advanced by
the libraries that all their business should
be considered by booksellers as an <b>independent
element</b> in the business and not
chargeable with the 28 per cent cost per
dollar of sale, but that the library business
should be charged with a much less
ratio of expense, thus enabling the bookseller
to gratify the desire of the libraries
for a further discount. They base this
proposition on the following claims:</p>


<ul><li>1. It does not call for the advertising of their wares by the dealer.</li>
<li>2. All skill of salesmanship is eliminated.</li>
<li>3. No accounts have to be charged off because of failure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The facts are that the smaller libraries,
and to some extent the larger libraries,
are constantly supplied by publisher and
bookseller with circular matter regarding
new and forthcoming publications, letters
and personal visits as to special publications,
as well as sending the new books,
as issued, on approval, at considerable
cost and trouble, and some loss of sale,
because books are not available for display
to possible buyers who visit the dealer's
place of business. The proper handling
of library orders to any reasonable
extent requires skilled clerks with good
knowledge of books, the use of catalogs
and the ability to work out titles correctly
that are incorrectly given, and which is so
often done. It is true that no accounts
have to be charged off, but library accounts
require much care and trouble in
making duplicate and triplicate vouchers,
many have to be sworn to before notaries,
in some cases depositing money as security
that goods will be supplied at prices
quoted, and generally a long wait before
the bills are paid, and many minor troubles
annoying to both libraries and dealers.</p>

<p>16. As a business proposition, the making
of a library department a separate one
from the business, and determining its exact
cost of maintenance, and basing the library
discount thereon is not feasible, for
the reason that the bulk of its operations
are so interwoven with the business, requiring
the assistance of the entire force
at many stages that it would be impossible
to pick out and determine what each operation
costs. Again, the profits and loss of
a business can only be finally determined
at the end of the fiscal year, when the
stock is taken, and the books closed&mdash;a
very anxious moment indeed for the bookseller.
He then knows, to his joy or sorrow,
how much it has cost him to make
one dollar of sale, and what profit or loss
he has made on each dollar of sale, on
every class of merchandise he has sold,
the library trade included. This percentage
of sale is his guide for the following
year, and as a good business man, he must
eliminate every class of merchandise he
sells that does not produce some profit.
No business can work successfully otherwise.</p>

<p>17. The following table will show the
various ramifications of a special library
department in the business, if carried out
as proposed. What suggestions would the
libraries make in a case like this?</p>

<p>18. The libraries state that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They have a right to protest against the
increasing charges made to them for passing
of the books of the publishers through
the hands of the booksellers, and that
some concession should be made in the
discounts now granted.</p></div>

<p>19. In this, the libraries should consider
they are not a trade organization,
who, like the booksellers, depend on their
trade for a living. Publisher and bookseller
are one in interest&mdash;producer and
distributor, and it is economically proper
that the publisher's product should pass
through the hands of the bookseller, and
to whom?&mdash;to their clientele, the public.
What relation does the library have to the
bookseller, other than as a buyer, the
same as the rest of the community? It is
claimed that libraries are large buyers collectively,
but the general public are larger
buyers collectively, by many millions of
dollars. If the library theory holds good,
would not the same theory hold good if
the citizens of each community were to
combine in their purchasing and demand
discounts accordingly? Would this not result
in the booksellers' sudden and complete
annihilation, instead of a gradual
one, as it has been?</p>

<p>20. As to the "increasing charges,"
there is no more increase to the libraries
than to the general public. What brought
about these "increasing charges?" The
necessity of self-preservation of both publisher
and bookseller. Till the beginning
of the net system and for some years
thereafter books were published at the traditional
prices of more than fifty years
ago (and later a period of ruinous competition
to the bookseller) the discounts to
the trade remaining about the same, and
this in spite of the fact that the cost of
everything pertaining to book-making and
its selling had greatly increased, and had
not advanced in price, while almost every
other article of merchandise, labor, material
and the necessities of life, has greatly
increased in cost, and increased in selling
price.</p>

<p>21. The libraries state:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We should regret to have the booksellers
take action which would give the libraries
the impression that their trade
was a burden to the bookseller, that your
members required a larger profit from
them than what is amply satisfactory to
the jobbing trade and many dealers.</p></div>

<p>22. The booksellers do not feel that the
libraries are a burden to them. They are
anxious to have trading relations with
them, but on a mutually satisfactory basis.
The library does not need profit for
its existence, supported as it is, but the
bookseller needs it for his very existence.
Were the libraries aware of the actual
facts of the case, they would undoubtedly
learn to their surprise that the trade done
by "the jobbing trade and many dealers"
was anything but satisfactory, and were
their dealings with the libraries closely
analyzed they would find they had made
small profit, if not loss, on the total of the
books sold to them. The dealers have only
shown existing conditions, and have asked
for relief.</p>

<p>23. The libraries are not sole buyers
of net books. A very large proportion of
their purchases are of non-net books,
which are sold to them at little or no margin
of profit, and at the same discount as
the booksellers get. This is ruinous competition.</p>

<p>24. Why then do the trade desire library
business under existing conditions?
They do not seek this business for its profit-making
on general publications, regular
and net, for that is almost nil, but for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
such stock as can be bought at much better
discount than the regular trade rates,
such as jobs and the like, that they can
sell the libraries, and also for the real
value of the libraries to the bookseller
that their orders often enable him to dispose
of certain stock&mdash;even at cost&mdash;which
might take a long time to dispose of.
Finally, there is a certain amount of pride&mdash;surprising
as it may seem&mdash;that the
bookseller has. He wants to sell the library
in his own community, he wants to
do all the business of his community, and
he feels it keenly that his library is the
only one with whom he cannot do business,
except at a very small profit or loss;
and which trade goes to some other town
or state.</p>

<p>25. We trust we have made clear to the
libraries the exact business situation as it
relates to the bookseller, jobber, and the
like. To some extent, what is stated here
is no new story. The general assertion
has been made by the bookseller that the
library business is unprofitable, while the
libraries state they believe otherwise is or
should be the case, and suggest their
ideas as to a remedy.</p>

<p>26. It can be proved, we think, to the
entire satisfaction of the libraries, that in
spite of the net system and corresponding
maintenance of price, the bookseller, jobber
and the like, will be happy indeed if
he can show the smallest margin of net
profit as a result of a year's work in selling
regular and net books to the libraries
and the public as well.</p>

<p>27. The booksellers, jobbers and the
like desire the library business. They believe
that it rightly belongs to them in
their own locality, and to no one else, be
they large or small.</p>

<p>28. They believe the discount given to
libraries by booksellers, jobbers and the
like, should be uniform the country over,
and leave a small margin of profit to the
seller.</p>

<p>29. They believe that competitive bidding
by the libraries has been detrimental
to booksellers, jobbers and the like, as
well as to the libraries in many ways, direct
and indirect.</p>

<p>30. They believe that the libraries desire
to be fair in this matter and not ask
for unreasonable terms, and that a knowledge
of the real facts of the case of the
condition of the booksellers, jobbers and
the like, will convince them that the booksellers,
jobbers and others are doing all,
if not more than they can, in giving the
libraries a discount of 33 1-3 per cent on
regular books, and 10 per cent on net
books, as at present.</p>

<p>31. Booksellers, jobbers and the like
fully believe that they can be of great assistance
to the libraries and the libraries
to them, and it is their earnest hope that
close and harmonious relations may be
brought about, and that they will do all in
their power towards it. The booksellers
most heartily endorse the great and good
work the libraries perform to the community,
and from a selfish point of view,
the bookseller freely admits the great assistance
derived by them from the influence
of the libraries in creating a desire
for reading and the possession of books,
and the general educating and elevating
of the community, and the bookseller also
feels that his presence in any community
is likewise educating and elevating and
that his interests should be reasonably
conserved.</p>

<p>32. The booksellers complain that
when libraries become publishers, as
many of them do, they make their prices
net but give the trade little or no discount
therefrom. Such books sold by the bookseller,
cost him considerable in addition
to the published price.</p>

<p>33. They cordially invite the librarians
to go into any facts and figures they may
desire to be informed about, as to the cost
of booksellers doing business and as to
the conditions affecting the relationship of
both, with a view that all difficulties may
be removed, to our mutual satisfaction.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>34. We are pleased to learn that the libraries believe&mdash;-</p>

<p>1. The approval feature can be dropped.</p>

<p>2. That no library should ask for
competitive bids on itemized lists.</p>

<p>3. The bibliographical work is entirely
unnecessary by the bookseller
and can be dispensed with.</p>

<p>4. That the relations between libraries
and the book trade should be
placed upon a business basis.</p>

<p>5. That there is no question as to the
desirability and the necessity of improving
the condition of the book trade, and
that they are in sympathy with the apparently
successful efforts now being
made toward that end.</p>


<h3>BOOKSELLERS SELLING TO LIBRARIES AND THE RESULT, IN PROFIT AND
LOSS TO THE BOOKSELLER.</h3>

<p>The following tabulation is compiled, from actual purchases made from four prominent
publishers, by a large bookseller, during a period of one year. These purchases
included books in all classes of literature, fiction, biography, science, travel, etc., etc.,
which would fairly represent the book purchases of a number of libraries for the period
of one year. These books were bought at varying discounts, viz.:&mdash;2/5, 2/5-5, 2/5-10,
&frac14;, &frac14;-5, &frac14;-10, 3/10, 3/10-5, 3/10-10, 1/3, 1/3-5, 1/3-10. Every advantage was taken
where possible, to obtain by quantity buying, the extra 5 and 10 per cent, given by the
publishers. The amount bought of these four publishers at published price was
about $37,035.87, which cost the bookseller about $24,000.00, and included both regular,
net and special books.</p>

<p>Let us assume that this bookseller sold these books from his stock to the libraries,
at a discount from the published prices, on regular books, of 1/3 and a discount of 10%
from the published prices of net books.</p>

<p>It is here shown, what the result of the operation would be to the bookseller, as
to profit or loss. The cost point of doing business by booksellers the country over,
has been fairly well determined to be on the same average, 28% per dollar of sale.
This may fluctuate according to circumstances and location, between 30% and 25%.
In order, however, to clearly and fully cover all possibilities in the matter, the expense
per dollar of sale has been calculated at 28%, 20%, 15%, 10% and 5% per dollar of sale.</p>

<p>In all these calculations per dollar of sale, no allowance is made for depreciation
of stock, fixtures, bad accounts, etc., etc.</p>

<p>It is hoped that a careful analysis of this table will help solve the library problem.</p>

<h3>June, 1913<br />

Report of the Bookbuying Committee of
the American Library Association,
1912-13</h3>

<p>In November, 1912, your committee was
notified by the secretary that the executive
board asked it to continue its negotiations
with the committee on libraries of
the American Booksellers' Convention.</p>

<p>A meeting with the latter committee
was immediately arranged for, and such
meeting was held in New York City on November
25th, which was attended by two
representatives of the Booksellers' Association
and by two members of the committee
on Book Buying of the A. L. A. A discussion
lasting over three hours, when all
the details and conditions were gone over,
resulted in a definite agreement, the ratification
of which the committee of the
American Booksellers' Association promised
to recommend to that Association.</p>

<p>This agreement was in the nature of a
small concession on the part of the Booksellers'
Committee. While the concession
was small, it was accepted as at least
showing a disposition on the part of the
Booksellers to co-operate with the libraries
in the promotion of a better feeling between
them. The Booksellers' Committee
agreed to allow the libraries a discount of
15% from the net price on new fiction, instead
of 10%, which is now allowed. The
15% discount was to be given during the
calendar year in which the novel was published,
as given on the title page.</p>

<p>A few days after this agreement was
made, the acting chairman of the American
Booksellers' Association committee
announced that he could not carry it out,
because of his finding that the booksellers
could not afford to do what he had promised
to recommend, and at that time submitted
figures which he thought proved his
contention. These figures differed in no
particular from those which were formerly
submitted, and which are a part of this
report, and which, we believe are on a
false basis of an exaggerated cost of doing
library business, and of misleading
statements as to discounts allowed by the
publishers to booksellers on new fiction.</p>

<p>At the annual meeting of the American
Booksellers' Association, which was held
in May of this year, a statement was made
by its committee on Relations with libraries,
but this statement does not form
a part of the published report of the proceedings
of the convention, and your committee
has not been able to obtain a copy
of the stenographer's notes. The acting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
chairman of the Booksellers' Committee
informs us that he made no report, but
that he submitted and supplemented the
foregoing statements of the committees,
with quotations from the correspondence
of the two committees. It, therefore, probably
differed but little from the original
statements made by the two committees.</p>

<p>We would, therefore, call your attention
to the reasons given in the Booksellers'
"Statement" for holding the uniform higher
prices which the libraries are paying
for books because of the short discounts
allowed by the Booksellers' Association.
As the position taken by the Booksellers'
Association is not agreed to by all of the
individual booksellers, such action may or
may not be looked upon as a "restraint of
trade."</p>

<p>The estimate of the cost of doing business
by retail booksellers is 28%, and the
contention is that no profit is made from
any item which does not net them a sum
greater than 28% above cost. This would
mean that they wish to force the libraries
into becoming retail customers because library
business as a wholesale trade is regarded
by the retail booksellers as too
costly, and the Booksellers' Committee believes
that it should not be welcomed by
them. All booksellers do not take this
view any more than they would wish to
endorse that expressed in paragraph 8 of
the "answer" of their committee, which
reads as follows: "A great majority of the
libraries are created and supported by direct
taxation, by charitable contributions,
endowments, legacies and the like. It is
true that libraries have to be conducted in
a careful, businesslike way, simply keeping
within their means. Doing this, they
are free from the booksellers' anxieties
and difficulties as a merchant."</p>

<p>Your committee believes that there is
no question as to the desire of all libraries
to encourage good feeling between the
booksellers and themselves, nor is there
any question as to the desirability of having
a bookstore in every community.</p>

<p>We believe that the local booksellers
should be encouraged, but not at the expense
of the taxpayers through the library.</p>

<p>The libraries, as wholesale buyers,
should, we believe, be allowed greater discounts
on the net books. As the retail
booksellers seem not included to make
any compromise, we believe that your
committee on Book Buying might, in the
immediate future, be of service to the libraries
by calling their attention to the
advantages of buying many replace books
from booksellers who are desirous of obtaining
and keeping the library business
and to those who deal in remainders and
second-hand books, both here and abroad.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the Booksellers' Committee
on Relations with libraries did not keep
its verbal promise, and has reassumed its
former position which allows no concession
whatsoever, although asking and expecting
co-operation from the libraries, we
believe that there is nothing to be gained
by further negotiations with the Booksellers'
Association Committee on Relations
with Libraries as it is now constituted.</p>

<h2>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON CO-OPERATION
WITH THE NATIONAL
EDUCATION ASSOCIATION</h2>


<p>The committee of the American Library
Association on co-operation with the National
Education Association, while having
no special accomplishment to present, still
seems justified in reporting the year as being
one decidedly of progress. Never before
in the experience of the committee has
there been a more friendly expression of
a desire to co-operate on the part of the
N. E. A. than has been the case this year.</p>

<p>President Fairchild sent an invitation
unsolicited for a representative of the
American Library Association to take a
place on the general program of the meetings
of the National Education Association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
in Salt Lake City. The committee has not
been able to find a proper representative
to accept the invitation, owing to the great
distance from library centers of the place
of meeting.</p>

<p>There has been an increased amount of
discussion by correspondence of the members
of the committee as to the work that
could be done more thoroughly to create
a sympathetic attitude toward the work
of the public library as an integral part of
public education.</p>

<p>An increasing number of schools are
turning to the libraries for help, and one
association of college librarians has strongly
emphasized the need of instruction in
library methods for the students of high
schools.</p>

<p>The committee has been active in its efforts
to co-operate with the library department
of the N. E. A., and has received a
written expression of thanks for its work
this year from the officers of the department.</p>

<p class="right">M. E. AHERN,<br />
Chairman.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL AND STATE
RELATIONS</h2>


<p>The committee reports that its chief
activity throughout the year, has been the
endeavor to secure a cheaper postal rate
upon books, in which effort it has been unsuccessful.
Attempts were made to have
books included in the parcel post bill of
1912, and also to have the rate on books
made the same as the second class rate
on magazines when sent by individuals.
At the regular and extra sessions of Congress,
the Chairman of the Committees of
Congress on Post Offices and Post Roads,
were interviewed, and the Postmaster-General
was urged to give the favorable
influence of his department toward the
end desired. There seems to be no probability
of an immediate alteration in the
rate upon books, unless a complete revision
of the parcel post section of the
postal laws be made, and there is some
question as to whether it is desirable for
books to be included in the parcel post,
with the present zone system, inasmuch
as under it, the postage upon books within
certain zones would be actually greater
than under the existing law. The activity
of those desiring a one cent postage upon
letters, also causes members of Congress
to hesitate in making any reduction such
as we desire.</p>

<p>When the new tariff bill was introduced
in the House of Representatives, the Committee
addressed a communication to the
Committee on Ways and Means, so as to
secure the retention of the privilege of
free entry for books imported by public
libraries. The Treasury Department on
April 19 decided "that small importations
through the mails for colleges or other institutions
entitled to import books free of
duty under Par. 519 of the Tariff Act will
be passed without requiring an affidavit in
each instance, provided such institutions
will file with the Collector of Customs a
copy of its charter or article of association
showing it to be entitled to pass such importations
free of duty." Libraries desiring
to avail themselves of this privilege
should forward this information promptly
to the Collector of Customs at the port
where they receive books.</p>

<h2>COMMITTEE ON LIBRARY ADMINISTRATION</h2>


<p>Part of your Committee's report is simply
supplementary to that of last year,
constituting with it a survey of methods
used in certain libraries in carrying out
two common operations&mdash;accessioning and
the charging of issue. Last year the selected
libraries were asked simply to describe
these operations closely, being
urged to leave out no detail, no matter
how trivial and unimportant. It was
thought that no set of questions, however
minute, would provide for all such details,
and that a questionnaire might result in
many omissions and make the operations,
as performed by the contributing libraries,
appear to be more uniform than is really
the case. The event proved, however, the
necessity of some sort of a questionnaire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
and after a study of last year's results the
following was prepared by Mr. George F.
Bowerman, of this committee, and sent
out by the chairman both to the libraries
named in the last report and to certain
others. Data have been received from the
following institutions:</p>

<p>We give below the questions sent out
with a summary of the various answers by
numbers. The original blanks are on file
at A. L. A. headquarters, showing answers
in greater detail, together with the names
of the answering libraries.</p>


<h3>Summary of Reports on Accession Routine</h3>

<p>[Harvard University library did not answer
each question in detail, as it keeps no
accession record in the usual sense. A
record is kept each day of the number of
volumes and pamphlets received by gift
and by purchase, from which statistics are
made up at the end of the year. A file of
continuation cards for annual reports and
similar continued publications and a record
of gifts from individuals are useful supplements
to the daily record. Bills for
books are filed alphabetically under dealer's
name each year, and order slips, giving
agent, date of order and date of receipt,
are preserved.]</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>(1) When do you accession, before or
after cataloging? Before cataloging&mdash;14.</p>

record do you use?</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>All use accession book except Los
Angeles and Forbes Library,

Washington, D. C., which uses
order cards as accession record.</p>

<p>East Orange does not believe accession
<b>book</b> essential.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh, which accessions only
adult books, is inclined to believe
book unnecessary. Their
method of treating juveniles is
especially interesting.</p>

<p>Seattle notes that their book has
fewer items than the A. L. A.,
and says the use of order cards
as accession record is an excellent
method.</p></div>

<p>(4) Which of the following items do you
enter in your accession record?</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>The number following the item indicates

<p>Affirmative, 19; negative, 5.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>b. What items do you include?</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Some of these questions were not
answered, so it is inferred that
the statistics obtained are for
total additions only. Following
items were reported on:&mdash;Class,
7; source, 8; branch, 2; language,
2; circulating or reference,
2; adult and juvenile, 2.</p></div>

<p>(7) Do you maintain a numerical record
of accessions according to classification?
Department or branches?
Does it cover expenditures for
each main class? Department or
branches?</p>

as well as accession number in the
book. Do you write cost of a set
in the first volume?</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Affirmative, 6; negative, 13 (both
questions); cost, 1; date, affirmative,
3; negative, 1; cost in volume
1 of set, 6.</p></div>

<p>(10) How do you indicate the branch or
department to which a book is assigned?</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Not indicated, or there is no
branch, 14; stamped or indicated
in accession book, 5; books
stamped or marked, 5; separate
accession book for each branch,
3; order card and book stamped,
2.</p></div>

<p>(11) In case of replacements do you keep
a record of the accession number
which has been replaced or do you
regard replacement as if it were
an added entry or duplicate, disregarding
old number entirely?</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>Replacement is regarded as an
added entry or duplicate, and no
record kept of the old number,
16; New number given to replacement
but make note of the
number replaced, 6; Old number
used, 3.</p>

<p>Butte, Mont., reports:</p></div>

on shelf list, 4; note in accession
book and keep withdrawal
book, 3; have withdrawal book,

<p>The most interesting thing brought out
by this investigation is the fact that it has
taken your committee two years to ascertain
and tabulate the simple facts regarding
methods of procedure, in a very limited
number of institutions, in the performance
of only two of the many operations that go
to make up their current work. From this
it may be imagined how long and difficult
a task it would be to carry out a really
comprehensive survey of all the work of all
kinds of libraries as currently performed.
And yet such a survey would appear to be
a necessary preliminary to a study of the
subject whose aims should be definite suggestions
toward the improvement of this
work in the direction of greater efficiency.
It would seem, at present, a task beyond
this committee's powers, although we may
be prepared to take general advisory
charge of such a work if others can be induced
to undertake the details. Possibly
some of the library schools may regard
this as profitable employment for their students.</p>

<p>In the next place we are struck with the
complete negative that our results place
upon the general impression that the various
details of modern library work are becoming&mdash;possibly
even have already become&mdash;thoroughly
standardized. No one
thinks, of course, that everyone does everything
alike; but we are apt to believe that
there are now a few generally approved
ways of doing each thing, and that each library
selects from these the one that suits
its own conditions and limitations. On the
contrary, we seem to be in an era of free
experiment. Nothing in the two sets of operations
that we have studied&mdash;not even
the existence and value of the operations
themselves&mdash;would appear to be regarded
as sacred. Everyone has his own methods
and is apparently satisfied, either with
them, or with his own ways of departing
from them and groping after something
better.</p>

<p>We cannot regard this as altogether desirable.
Doubtless no one most efficient
way of doing any of these things can be
settled upon, so long as conditions differ,
but we cannot believe that differences so
fundamental and complexities so varied as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
those revealed in this report are due merely
to differing conditions, and that each is
the best in the place where it is practised.
We must conclude, therefore, that many
of our libraries are doing these particular
things, and by inference others also, in
wasteful, inefficient ways.</p>

<p>Having made a survey of the facts, the
next step would be to inquire concerning
all variations from a method selected as
the simplest in each case&mdash;possibly accessioning
as practised at Pratt Institute Free
Library or the Public Library of the District
of Columbia and the charging system
at Pittsburgh or at East Orange, New Jersey.
The cost of these variations in time
and money and the skill necessary in carrying
them out, should be ascertained and
the practical value of each, if it has any,
should be found. It may then be possible
to select, for a library of a given type, a
standard method of procedure, which will
be, all things considered, the most efficient
for it.</p>

<p>In regard to cost, the report of the sectional
committee on the cost of cataloging,
to be made at this conference, will doubtless
throw some interesting light on the
problem.</p>


<h3>Questionnaires</h3>

<p>The use of the questionnaire by this
committee may require some justification
in the light of the growing feeling among
librarians that the multiplicity of such demands
upon their time is becoming a nuisance;
and possibly some general recommendations
on the use of library questionnaires
may be in order.</p>

<p>We feel that the value of the questionnaire,
and the way in which it should be
received, regarded and disposed of, depend
primarily on the purpose for which it is
intended and also largely on the skill and
tact of the questioner. We distinguish
three main classes of library questionnaires:
(1) Those intended to gather data
for the information of librarians in general;
(2) those intended for the use of single
libraries; (3) those intended for the
information of individuals. Those of the
first class, it seems to us, it is the duty of
all librarians to answer, as far as possible.
They include questions sent out by A. L. A.
or state association committees and those
put by individual libraries or librarians
with a promise to publish the results or
to put them into shape that will make
them available to the public, provided, of
course, the information sought appears
likely to be of value when tabulated.</p>

<p>Questionnaires of the second class will
generally be answered, not so much as a
matter of public duty as of personal courtesy.
They include requests from one librarian
to another about details of administration
for guidance in making improvements
or alterations in method. A librarian
feels usually that it is good policy, if
nothing more, to comply with such requests
so far as his rules permit, for he
may at any time desire to make a similar
request on his own part. It is suggested,
however, that whenever possible such data
as these should be asked in a way, and
from a sufficient number of libraries, to
warrant throwing the results into a form
that will make them generally available.</p>

<p>The third category includes most of the
questionnaires that excite the ire of librarians
and cause a feeling that questions of
all kinds are nuisances demanding abatement.
They come from students writing
theses, from assistants preparing papers
for local clubs, from individuals obsessed
with curiosity, from reporters, from persons
of various degrees of irresponsibility.
There is no reason why any attention at
all should be paid to these and we recommend
librarians to return to them merely
a stereotyped form of polite acknowledgement
and refusal.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the Headquarters of the
Association may become more and more
the clearing house for systematized information
of this kind, saving thereby much
wasteful duplication of material and effort.
We recommend that the originators of legitimate
questionnaires send to Headquarters
before making up their list of questions,
to see how many can be answered
in this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Much of the feeling against questionnaires
is due to lack of good judgment on
the part of the framers. It is obviously
unfair to ask another librarian to answer
questions that could be answered from the
resources of the questioning library, even
if the latter would require a little more
time and trouble. A large proportion of
the items in questionnaires of all three
grades specified above are of this character.
If it is desired that all the answers
shall appear in the same form on one
sheet, answers obtainable in the questioning
library may be written in before sending
out the list, and the attention of the
correspondent may be called to this fact.
In any case a statement should accompany
the questionnaire that the information
asked cannot be obtained by any
other means at the asker's disposal.</p>

<p>In some cases questions are asked that
require the collection of unusual data regarding
the current work of the library.
The answers to such questions can evidently
not be given, even if the library is
willing and anxious to undertake at once
the additional work of collection, until the
expiration of the period for which the figures
are asked&mdash;generally one year. The
usual method seems to be to send out
such questions to a large number of libraries
in the hope that a few will be able
to answer them at once. A better way
would be to send out to a large number of
libraries a statement of the desired data,
asking those willing to undertake their collection
to notify the asker. At the expiration
of the period of collection the
sender of the questions would then have
accurate data and he would not expect
them before the end of this period&mdash;whether
one year or less.</p>

<p>It would seem to be unnecessary to remind
those who receive and answer questionnaires
that returned blanks should
bear the name of the library to which they
refer, were it not for the fact that this is
so often omitted. In one recent case the
name was given simply as "Carnegie library,"
with no address.</p>

<p>Briefly set forth, the recommendations
of this committee, regarding the use of library
questionnaires, are, then, as follows:</p>

<p>(1) That questionnaires should always
be for the information of librarians in general,
or for improving the service of one
library in particular, preferably the former.</p>

<p>(2) That no questions should be included
that can be answered in the questioning
library or at A. L. A. Headquarters.</p>

<p>(3) That questions requiring the collection
of current data over a specified period
of time be asked proportionately in advance
of the report desired, in cases where
the data are not such as are usually recorded.</p>

<p>(4) That those who answer questionnaires
be careful to include the name and
address of their library.</p>


<h3>Labor Saving Devices</h3>

<p>It is a commonplace of library history
that librarianship has contributed the card
catalog idea to commercial life. The library
in turn is indebted to commercial life for
many labor-saving devices. Very likely a
few of the largest libraries utilize all available
labor-saving devices to the utmost.
Your committee is, however, of the opinion
that the medium size and smaller libraries
might reduce the cost of administration
through the more general use of mechanical
appliances. We recommend that at a
coming meeting of the Association there
be held an exhibition of all available competing
labor-saving devices adapted to library
use. The assembled demonstration
of such devices should prove most instructive
to the members of the association
and would itself be a time-saving device.
Such an exhibition could probably not be
advantageously assembled except in a
large city. Your committee therefore recommends
that either it or a special committee
be authorized to arrange for such
an exhibition and demonstration.</p>

<h2>COMMITTEE ON LIBRARY TRAINING</h2>


<p>At the beginning of the year the committee
began the consideration of an outline,
prepared by the chairman, of possible
points considered in the proposed examination
of library schools. This outline was
submitted to the members of the committee
individually and valuable suggestions
obtained and was afterwards discussed by
such members of the committee as were
present at the January meetings in Chicago.</p>

<p>This outline which is appended to the
present report is not to be considered as
necessarily final, for the committee invites
criticisms and suggestions from other
members of the profession. What the committee
desires if library schools are to be
examined, is that the schools should be examined
from the point of view of the
needs of the profession, not simply from
the point of view of the interests of the
library schools. The real vital questions lying
at the foundation of the examination
of library schools are these: Does this
method of obtaining recruits for the profession
give the best results which can be
secured by such a method? Do the library
school trained workers prove in actual experience
that their training has been of the
right sort? These questions cannot be answered
from an examination of the records
of any one or even any half dozen library
school graduates, but only from the examination
of many such records.</p>

<p>As was before said, criticisms on the outline
are invited from members of the profession
and from any of the library schools,
as the desire of the committee is to make
an absolutely thorough, and impartial
study of the whole library school problem.</p>

<p>At the January meeting in Chicago the
members of the committee were rejoiced
to learn that the executive board had re-appropriated
the appropriation for 1912
with a like amount for the work of 1913.</p>

<p>With these financial limitations in mind
the committee considered the question of
an examiner, and one having been agreed
upon, made the proposition with great confidence,
only after considerable delay to
have it declined. Further search through
the field discovered another person who
seemed equally suitable and she was approached
only to decline.</p>

<p>The real difficulty evidently lies in the
fact that we are asking the examiner to
undertake a large piece of professional
work and practically offering only expenses
and the cost of a substitute for
the regular work during such times as it
is necessary to leave it. Naturally enough,
it is not easy to find anyone willing to take
this additional burden.</p>

<p>The committee now have in consideration
other names and hope, if reappointed,
to be able to announce an examiner before
the beginning of the next library school
year to such schools as indicate their readiness
to receive an examination.</p>

<h2>COMMITTEE ON WORK WITH THE
BLIND</h2>


<p>The libraries which circulate embossed
books have continued their services
throughout the year with ever increasing
results, the largest circulation having been
attained by the New York public library,
which circulated 21,938 books and pamphlets.
The Free library of Philadelphia sent
out 17,706 volumes; the Carnegie library
of Pittsburgh, 3,218; the Perkins Institution,
6,000; Wilmington, Delaware, 567.</p>

<p><b>Library of Congress.</b> The most important
event in the history of the Reading
Room for the Blind during the year was
the appointment of Mrs. Gertrude T. Rider
as Assistant in charge.</p>

<p><b>Perkins Institution.</b> The school is now in
its new home where the library is housed in
commodious quarters, and is in charge of
a trained librarian from Albany, Miss
Laura M. Sawyer, and a trained assistant
from Simmons, Miss Louise P. Hunt, who
devote their time to the care of the valu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>able
special collection in ink print about
the blind as well as to the circulation of
embossed books.</p>

<p><b>New York State Library.</b> Eight new
titles in New York point were embossed
for the New York state library in 1912
and an additional list of well chosen titles
is now in press for 1913.</p>

<p><b>Saginaw, W. S., Michigan.</b> The Free lending
library for the blind has asked the
legislature for $2,000 to replenish the collection
with new books. Of 202 borrowers
the librarian reports that 117 persons have
drawn no reading matter during the latter
half of the year.</p>

<p><b>California State Library.</b> Mr. Charles S.
Greene, of the committee, sends the following
report of the work of the State library
and the San Francisco reading
room:</p>

<p>The California state library for the blind
wishes to report progress during the last
year. Although we have had very little
money to buy books, accessions have increased
from 2,309, April 1, 1912, to 2,659
April 1, 1913, mainly through gifts and the
regular receipt of magazines. Borrowers
have increased from 475 to 550. The most
satisfactory advance, however, has been
in the increased use the blind borrowers
are making of the library in borrowing all
kinds of writing appliances and games to
try before buying and in asking information
on all subjects of interest to them.
Such questions as what occupations are
followed by the blind, and where different
articles for their use can be purchased, are
constantly being asked. With an increase
in the State library fund, which the present
legislature will probably grant, it is
hoped to buy all the new publications as
fast as possible, as well as to complete our
collection of appliances for the blind.</p>

<p>The San Francisco reading room and
library for the blind has about 400 volumes.
It conducts an emporium for the
sale of articles made by the blind and
teaches Braille reading and writing, Braille
stenography, weaving, basketry and broom
making.</p>

<p><b>Pennsylvania.</b> All borrowers residing in
the western part of the state are now supplied
with books from the Carnegie library
of Pittsburgh; those residing in the
eastern part of the state have the use of
books deposited with the Free library of
Philadelphia by the Pennsylvania home
teaching society.</p>

<p><b>Cincinnati, Ohio.</b> Miss Smith, of the
committee, sends the following report:
"There seems to be nothing new here in
the library work for the blind. The Clovernook
Home, which is to be opened May
30, has absorbed the attention largely of
Miss Trader and her sister and this spring
the flood interfered somewhat with the
meetings at the library."</p>

<p><b>Minnesota.</b> Miss Carey, of the committee,
writes as follows of the work in Minnesota:
"As far as I know the entire work
of providing books for the blind in this
state is done through the School for the
Blind at Faribault. The library there is
in excellent condition, being on a wholly
modern basis as to classification and details
of management. It is open throughout
the year and circulates to outside
readers on an average 25 books a month.
There are 80 regular readers outside the
institution and about 90 in residence this
year. As the school is small this is a large
number. The librarian in charge is one of
the teachers and for years in this school
it has been considered something of an
honor to hold this position, although it is
by no means a sinecure.... The library
work is always stimulated by the annual
summer school for adult blind which
brings in new readers each year. At the
close of the session the pupils, many of
them, become patrons of the library 'for
good.'"</p>

<p><b>New Publications.</b> Since the first embossed
book was issued in Philadelphia in
1833, the publishing of literature in raised
print has been increased until there are
now 16 presses in active use in this country.
The record of new publications for
1912 is as follows:</p>

<p>American Braille, 56 titles in English; 2
titles in German.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>New York point, 14 titles, of which 8
were embossed by the New York state library.</p>

<p>In European Braille new titles have been
issued in England and Scotland; in Moon
type 11 titles have been added and 10
other titles are in press.</p>

<p><b>The Catholic Review</b>, monthly, published
by the Xavier free publication society for
the blind, 824 Oakdale Avenue, Chicago,
Ill., in American Braille.</p>

<p><b>The Illuminator</b>, a quarterly Braille magazine,
published by the Holmes-Schenley
literary society of the Western Pennsylvania
Institution for the Blind, Pittsburgh,
Pa.</p>

<p><b>Society for the Promotion of Church
Work Among the Blind.</b> Volumes 3 and 4
of the music of the Hutchins' Hymnal have
been finished and copies distributed to a
number of the leading circulating libraries
where the volumes will be available to
those who may not wish to purchase them.</p>

<p><b>Bible Training School</b>, South Lancaster,
Mass. "Some friends of the blind, in looking
over the catalogs of books in different
libraries for the blind, were impressed
with the small amount of Christian literature
that had been placed in the embossed
type, especially in New York point and
American Braille, so the plan was conceived
of creating a fund and printing one
book after another as the funds would accumulate,
placing them in the circulating
libraries throughout the United States."
To obtain the volumes in New York point
and American Braille, free of charge, address
Mrs. S. N. Haskell, South Lancaster,
Mass.</p>

<p><b>Gould Free Library for the Blind</b>, 555
East 6th Street, South Boston, Mass. "The
library is working under the auspices of
the International Bible Students' Association
headquarters, Brooklyn, N. Y., which
supplies financial aid in the main, while
donations have been accepted from outsiders.
Our books are all Bible studies,
very helpful and appreciated by the blind.
We circulated 3,474 books and pamphlets
last year in the three point systems and a
few books in Line type and Moon type."</p>

<p><b>Free Theosophical Circulating Library
for the Blind</b>, 32 Waverly Street, Everett,
Mass., has issued three titles in American
Braille; also a monthly paper of 7 or 8
pages.</p>

<p><b>New postal law.</b> Under an act of Congress
of August 24, 1912, "magazines, periodicals
and other regularly issued publications
in raised letters for the blind,
which contain no advertisements and for
which no subscription fee is charged, shall
be transmitted in the U. S. mails free of
postage and under such regulations as the
Postmaster General may prescribe."</p>

<p><b>The Twelfth Convention of Workers for
the Blind</b> will be held in Jacksonville, Illinois,
June 24-27, 1913, and among those
who will attend the conference are several
representatives from public libraries
interested in the circulation of embossed
literature. Miss L. A. Goldthwaite, of the
New York public library, has been asked
to conduct a round table. In the general
discussion of the subject of catalogs for
the blind it is hoped to obtain the best
opinion of those in attendance upon the
most convenient form for such catalogs or
finding lists for use by those who read by
touch. The Library of Congress, the New
York public library, the Brooklyn public
library, the New York state library, the
Free library of Philadelphia, as well as
institutions for the blind, will be represented
by the assistants in charge of the
circulation of embossed books.</p>

<p>At this conference there will be given
the report of the "Uniform Type Committee"
appointed at the Overbrook conference
in 1911. The two agents of that committee,
who made an extended tour of this
country from May, 1912, until February,
1913, visited many schools and other institutions
for the blind and tested over 900
readers in one or more of the three systems&mdash;New
York point, American Braille
and British Braille. Scientific tests to determine
the best size of type, spacing, etc.,
have been made to establish a standard
or uniform system of writing and printing.
The recommendations of the committee
have been reserved until the meeting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
the American Association of Workers for
the Blind at Jacksonville; they are awaited
with interest by all.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: As you will see from
your printed programs we are privileged
this morning to receive an accredited delegate
from the Library Association of the
United Kingdom, and it is our especial
pleasure to greet as this accredited delegate
an old friend of American librarians.
He was with us at the Conference of 1904,
and we have since that time watched with
a great deal of interest the strong, splendid
work which is manifest in the library over
which he presides. I have the honor of
introducing to you this morning the Honorary
Secretary of the Library Association
of the United Kingdom and the accredited
delegate from that organization, Mr. L.
STANLEY JAST, chief librarian of the
Croydon Public Libraries.</p>

<p>Mr. BOWKER: And, Mr. President, I
move that we receive our welcome guest
from the L. A. U. K. by a rising vote of
welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. Jast spoke as follows:</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>PRESENT CONDITIONS AND TENDENCIES
OF LIBRARY WORK IN
GREAT BRITAIN</h2>


<p>Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen: I
should like first of all to express the
peculiar personal pleasure I feel at being
privileged for the second time to
attend a conference of the American Library
Association. As you have said, sir, it
was my pleasure in 1904 to attend a meeting
of your body, then as now the accredited
delegate of my Association, but that
meeting of 1904 was, as you know, an international
meeting, and an international
meeting anywhere is apt to take on general
rather than special characteristics, and I
have long wished to be present at an ordinary
meeting of the American Library
Association, so that I might see for myself
how you conduct your work and hear you
discussing your own problems in your own
way. So that I trust, Mr. President and
ladies and gentlemen, that you will kindly
forget that</p>

<p class="center">"A chiel's amang ye takin' notes."
</p>

<p>I am authorized by the Council of the Library
Association to extend to you, sir, and
the members present their very heartiest
greetings and to express on their behalf
their high appreciation not only of the special
invitation which you sent to them to
send a delegate but for the extremely generous
offer of hospitality which was attached
thereto. My Council felt that to
such an invitation only one response is
possible and that was to accept.</p>

<p>We were in hope that Mr. Henry R. Tedder,
who is the chairman of the Council of
the Library Association and its honorary
treasurer and an ex-president,&mdash;and otherwise
the secretary of the Athenaeum Club,&mdash;would
have come as our delegate, because
Mr. Tedder's importance is intrinsic
and not like mine purely adventitious and
depending wholly upon the office which I at
the moment have the privilege to hold; but
it was impossible for Mr. Tedder to come
on this occasion and, ladies and gentlemen,
I am the best that we can do for you at
this time.</p>

<p>But I am happy to say that it is the general
feeling of the Council that in future
we should not let many meetings of the
A. L. A.&mdash;at all events in the eastern
states&mdash;go by without sending one or more
members of our Association to be present
at them. I do not think that there is anything
from which our Association is likely
to get a more valuable return than by the
visits of some of its more prominent members
to America in order that they may
see for themselves and not merely read
about what you are doing, and how you are
doing it and get some knowledge of the
conditions under which you are working,
of your achievements and of your difficulties,
and so bring to library work in Great
Britain that added power which must inevitably
come from a wider knowledge. So
that I trust that the imperfections of the
present delegate will be overlooked, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
hope not only of more but of better to
come.</p>

<p>I am also requested by my Council to extend
a very hearty invitation to the members
of the American Library Association
to attend the annual meeting of the Library
Association to be held in 1914. That
meeting will almost certainly be held at
Oxford, by invitation of the University and
of the city. I need not of course point out
the extreme suitability of the city of Oxford
for a meeting of librarians, nor the
attractions which Oxford must possess for
everyone who likes an atmosphere of ancient
learning and who revels in the architectural
glories of a bygone day. So we
hope that as many of you as possible will
come over there for that meeting in order
that we may make of it a sort of Americo-Anglican
conference. Observe the order,
please, in which I mention those words. I
draw special attention to that because I
believe I have somewhat of a reputation
for an absence of tact on these occasions&mdash;at
any rate among our own members.</p>

<p>When I informed Mr. Utley that I was
coming he was good enough to write me a
letter, which I received just before I sailed,
and he asked&mdash;not knowing me very well
of course, or he might not have been so
liberal in his invitation&mdash;that I should talk
to you on any subject I liked. I thought
that it would be best perhaps if I should
say something about the present conditions
of library work in Great Britain. Of course
it is impossible, in an address lasting only
a few minutes, to cover anything like the
whole field, and if I did attempt it I should
only bore you. But you may be interested
in one or two of the outstanding features
of our recent work, because they throw
light upon conditions which are in many
respects very different from yours. First
of all, there are two features in what I may
perhaps call the domestic situation, which
to us are of considerable significance. The
most important step which the Library Association
as an association has ever taken
has been the recent reorganization of its
membership along the lines of the professional
qualifications of the members. In
our old grouping we took no account whatever
of whether a member of the Association
was a professional librarian or merely
a member of a library committee or just a
person interested in library work. The
honorary fellows of the Association and
the fellows were any persons, whether librarians
or not, whose names would add
dignity and importance to the Association,
or who had distinguished themselves by
some special service rendered to the Association
or the movement as a whole.
Then in addition Mr. Tedder himself had a
small group of what he called <i>very</i> honorary
fellows who were the honorary fellows
who insisted on paying their annual
dues. That was an entirely private group
of Mr. Tedder's. Now we have changed all
that. Fellows and members of the Association
are now professional librarians
only, and non-professional librarians are
known as associate members. The privileges
of membership including the power
to vote and to serve on the Council are
shared equally by all members of the Association.
The fellows consist in the main
of librarians only, but there is a small
sprinkling of deputy and sub-librarians.
The by-law referring to fellows who do not
hold chief positions states that "they must
be librarians of approved status," but we
interpret that phrase "approved status" in
the widest possible way. The members
consist of assistant librarians&mdash;all those
assistant librarians who are not in the
small group of fellows; they must be twenty-five
years of age and have had six years'
experience. That is so at the moment. But
after the 31st day of December, 1914, only
librarians who possess the diploma of the
Association will be entitled to fellowship,
and in order to receive the diploma you
must have taken in addition to possessing
practical experience in an approved library,
the six examinations held by the Association,
have obtained the six certificates,
have gone through if necessary a
<span class="sans">vive voce</span> examination and have submitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
a thesis. Then professional librarians who
possess four out of the six certificates will
be entitled to membership. A good deal
of criticism has been leveled at the scheme
owing to the fact that the librarian of some
pettifogging little library, with perhaps a
total rate income of a couple of hundred a
year or even less, because he is a chief in
a small way, is entitled to fellowship, while
an assistant in a big library system, who
may have infinitely more responsibility, is
only entitled to membership. But we had
to begin somewhere and we had to draw
the line somewhere and we drew the line
at the sub-librarian, because when we got
below the sub-librarian we should not know
where on earth we were, because there is
no accepted nomenclature of library positions
in our country. I do not know
whether there is in yours. "Sub-librarian"
does not always mean the same thing. The
term "chief assistant" is used in a very
different way in different libraries. Moreover,
the Privy Council would not have
approved these by-laws unless we had
opened the door as widely as possible to
the holders of all existing chief positions.</p>

<p>There is one weak point so far which we
have discovered in our scheme. We have
no provision for non-professional members
corresponding to professional fellowship
among the professional members, but we
have a new by-law now before the Privy
Council creating a group of associate
fellows and the associate fellowship will
be conferred upon chairmen of library
committees and upon non-professional
members of the Association who have
served the Association in some definite capacity
as members of the Council or in
some other way.</p>

<p>That, I think, then is the most important
domestic thing that we have ever done because
we have now made the beginnings
at all events of a definite organization of
the profession.</p>

<p>The other important thing will not have
the same interest for you, but I mention it
because it throws light upon our own conditions.
We have settled, by a new by-law,
the relations of branch associations to
the parent body. Until recently we had a
by-law which merely provided that
branches in any particular district may be
formed but it did not state what the powers
of the branches were, and owing to
that absence of definition we have suffered
for a great many years past from a considerable
amount of trouble. One or two of
the branches grew considerably in recent
years, in numbers and in importance; and
they began to resent the fact, the inevitable
fact of course, that for the most part
the actual work of running the Association
fell upon the members of the Council who
were resident in London or near it. It may
seem absurd to you to speak of the distance
of London from the great provincial
centers in Great Britain, but it is not absurd,
because every country measures distance
on its own scale, and to all intents
and purposes Manchester is just as far
from London as Chicago is from New
York&mdash;because we <b>think</b> it is. As Hamlet
says, you will remember&mdash;anticipating
Mrs. Eddy by several centuries&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is nothing either good or bad, but
thinking makes it so."</p></div>

<p>And as an illustration of the result of this
friction I may mention that in London, at
the library school&mdash;which is hardly a library
school because it has not the organization
that your schools have, so I ought
not to use that term really, but a department
of library lectures at the London
School of Economics and Political Science,
which is a department of the University of
London; at these lectures all persons are
admissible whether they are librarians or
not, but at similar lectures in the provinces
everybody was excluded who was not already
engaged in library work. So that
you had the absurd situation that while
the parent body was running one policy at
headquarters you had branch associations
running an entirely different policy in their
own centers. The question of the "open
door," as it was termed, was a very hotly
debated one at one time in our Association.
Well, the general effect of the stress between
the branches and the Council was
of course bad, each branch being a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
or less permanent storm center. While no
absolute harm was done perhaps, and while
the fireworks let off at the annual meetings
were of a more or less harmless character,
at the same time we had a general condition
of irritation which affected injuriously
the work of the Association as a whole.
Now we have done away with that, very
largely at all events, at least, we hope, by
a new by-law, the main points of which are
these: First of all, membership of a
branch association includes membership of
the parent body; the parent body receiving
the subscription to the branch association
returns to the branch association a rebate
of so much a head for the expenses of
the branch and, most important of all, the
constitution and by-laws of a branch must
be approved by the headquarters council
and must in no case conflict with the by-laws
and constitution of the parent body.</p>

<p>The Council meets monthly, I may say,
and one of the quarterly meetings is held
on the occasion of the annual meeting. So
that means that the expenses of the provincial
members are paid to three of the
quarterly meetings held during the year;
and all the important business&mdash;especially
contentious business&mdash;is relegated to those
quarterly meetings.</p>

<p>Leaving the domestic question and coming
to the library situation as a whole in
Great Britain, I think that the phrase
"marking time" fairly describes it. The
public libraries in the United Kingdom
have accomplished, I think, great things
with extremely limited means. But though
the first library act was passed in 1850,
though the libraries have since then justified
themselves many times over, though
the demands made upon the libraries have
gone on increasing time after time, yet the
libraries are still strangled by the statutory
limitation of one-penny-in-the-pound
on the tax leviable for library purposes
which was imposed not by the Ewart Act
of 1850, which limited the rate to a halfpenny,
but by the amending act of 1855.
It is quite true that about forty of the
large towns of the country have promoted
special parliamentary bills giving them
power to levy a rate of two-pence or even
more in the pound, but in very few cases is
two-pence actually levied, and of course
it is the smaller towns, which can not face
the expense of promoting special legislation,
which really need greater rating powers
even more than the larger boroughs.</p>

<p>As the incidence of a library tax in Great
Britain is quite different from yours I may
perhaps give you some general idea of what
it means by taking the case of my own
town, simply because I happen to remember
the facts more clearly. Croydon is a
town in the outer London ring, with a population
of 174,257 people. Its income from
the penny rate is a little over &pound;4,000 sterling.
It circulates about 555,000 volumes
per annum and its fiction percentage is
about fifty. Whether that is something to
be apologized for or not I am not quite
clear, after the president's address of last
evening. Then one has to remember that
the ratable value of a place like Croydon
is a good deal higher than the ratable value
of most of the provincial towns. But those
figures will give you a general idea of the
yield of the penny-in-the-pound rate. A
rate of that kind results, you will easily
see, in the case of the smaller towns, in a
condition of genteel poverty, and in the
case of many small towns of absolute hopeless
starvation. And this unfortunate position
has been accentuated by the tremendous
growth of branches in recent years.
Of the three b's which constitute a library&mdash;building,
brains and books,&mdash;the ordinary
British rate-payer thinks mainly of buildings.
The building usually does not cost
him anything, because he gets it from Mr.
Carnegie, and it is something to look at
and something "we've got for our ward,
don't you know," books will drop from the
sky, and "anyhow you don't require brains
to hand books over a counter." Hence,
from this you have a town, which will perhaps
support, in passable efficiency, one
central building and two branches, endeavoring
to support one central building perhaps
and six branches, and so on. Hence
the limited book funds which we have in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
our libraries and hence on the whole the
poorly remunerated library staffs.</p>

<p>And that brings me to a point which it
was suggested to me by one of your members
I should say something about, and
that is the position of women in English
public libraries. I am not going to express
any opinion on the subject of women
in libraries. After all, as George Bernard
Shaw says somewhere, opinions are really
only serious when you act on them, and
my capacity for courage has never been
equal to the task of acting upon many of
my opinions. But as things are at present,
a number of libraries employ women assistants.
There are very few places where
women are chief librarians; there are a
few in the quite small towns. There are
very few libraries which have women sub-librarians
or deputy-librarians. These are
almost invariably men. But the number
of women employed in secondary and tertiary
positions in English public libraries
is considerable and is very definitely increasing.
And whether that be a good
thing or a bad thing, I am quite clear about
this, that it is increasing for the wrong
reason. Women are employed in English
public libraries not because they are better,
but because they are cheaper&mdash;with
the unfortunate result that the increase of
women in the library staffs tends necessarily
to lower the already low average of
salaries paid.</p>

<p>The Library Association have long recognized
of course that the root of all our
present difficulties lies in the limitation
on the library income, and in order to do
away with that they have been promoting
for the last three or four years or more a
library bill, the main clause of which permits
a town to levy a rate, not exceeding
two-pence-in-the-pound, that is exactly double
the present amount. When we originally
drafted the bill we did away with
the limitation altogether, but we have now
put a limitation in order to placate possible
opposition. That bill has been already
read once before the present parliament&mdash;but
the first reading of course is a purely
formal matter; it is the second reading
which is the crucial one; and owing to the
exasperating nature of the orders of the
House of Commons any one member has
only to rise in his seat and say, "I object,"
to a private member's bill for that bill to
be labeled "contentious business" and for
its second reading to be deferred to the
Greek kalends, owing of course to the enormous
number of private members' bills and
to the growing inefficiency of the House
of Commons as a legislating machine. It
is choked with bills and it can not adequately
attend to the thousand-and-one
matters which call for its attention. The
best chance for the bill would be for the
government to grant facilities for it. If
they would do that I have not the slightest
doubt that the bill would pass because
so far as we can see there is little or no
serious opposition to it; but we can not get
it discussed. The unfortunate fact seems
to be that the government will not worry
about anything which does not sway votes.
Nobody is going to get excited about a library
bill. If it is true that there is no
particular opposition to it, it is also true
that there is no crowd of electors passionately
demanding it.</p>

<p>Then we suffer to a considerable extent
in Great Britain from the attitude of the
superior people to the public library. In
America all the superior people are sympathetic
with the public library&mdash;apparently
so anyhow. In England usually they sneer
at it. Why, Heaven knows! Only the
other day a cabinet minister who was considered
to be a friend of ours, whose name
before he reached cabinet rank was actually
a backer to a bill on similar lines to
the present one, in a meeting which he addressed
referred to the country as being
"drenched" with public libraries. I
think his point was the far greater importance
of public wash-houses or
something of that sort. And, as I say,
he used the extremely unpleasant, and
peculiarly unappropriate adjective "drenched."
Now of course no one objects to a
cabinet minister talking nonsense. After
all, what else can you talk to a popular audience
in politics but nonsense? But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
particular variety is pernicious nonsense.
The press, of course, with their usual avidity
for seizing on anything silly, print that
sort of thing ad nauseam and a good deal
of real harm is done and difficulty created.
I think the minister in question has
stated somewhere that he owes a great
part of his own education to the public library.
Mr. Carnegie has said the same
thing. Behold how differently men requite
the benefits they have received!</p>

<p>Well, Mr. President and ladies and gentlemen,
I have perhaps given you the idea
that I take a rather pessimistic view of library
conditions at the present moment in
Great Britain, but that is not so at all&mdash;most
emphatically not so. I am absolutely
convinced that the future of the public library
in Great Britain is as certain as it is
with you, and though the next step forward
may be delayed, the longer it is delayed
the bigger that step will be when it is
taken.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: Mr. Honorary Secretary
and our Guest: I would that the gift
of speech had been given me that I might
adequately express to you the sense of appreciation
that we all feel for your coming,
for your gracious words of greeting in behalf
of your Association and for the view
that you have given us of not only the conditions
that obtain in Great Britain but also
what the future holds forth for the libraries
of your country. In our American
assemblages it is customary, when some
procedure is taken that no one is particularly
interested in, to pass it by; but when
something transpires that requires further
and more careful thought it is our parliamentary
custom to refer this to a committee.
In this particular case I am sure that
I am meeting the wish of the Association
as well as my own personal desire when
I refer your splendid message to a committee
of the whole, consisting of all the
librarians present, all the members who
have unavoidably been kept at home and
that other, smaller group who come within
the classification of Mr. Dewey's "private
collections." What you have said to us,
sir, has emphasized to us particularly that
not only is there in the relationship between
your libraries in Great Britain and
ours in this country a kinship of interest,
brought about through identical language,
and a kinship of literature, but also there
are common aims and aspirations. Just
as the language is subject to local variations,
due to the customs of geographical
centers, so there are differences in method
perhaps. But, after all, we are each, in
our own way, attempting to do the same
things and to achieve a common purpose.
I trust, sir, that you will convey to your
associates in Great Britain our gratitude
for the kindly expressions which you have
brought to us from them, and we venture
the hope that we shall be enabled to carry
forward the splendid precedent which has
been set in your coming.</p>

<p>As you glance at the names of those who
are to participate at this session, you will
note that this is practically New York
Day; the one, sole participant who is credited
to another part of the country is after
all perhaps merely loaned to Missouri, because
he is a graduate of the New York
library school. I shall ask the First Vice-President,
Mr. Anderson, to preside over
the rest of this meeting.</p>

<p>The FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT: Ladies
and gentlemen, I can take that kind of
punishment with great composure. The
subject for the regular program this morning,
as you all know, is work with foreigners
and with the colored races. I have
the honor to be a neighbor of the first
speaker and I may say to you confidentially
that she has recently moved a mile
or two farther away from me without adequate
explanation. The author of "The
Promised Land" needs no introduction to
this audience. All of you have read with
enthusiasm and appreciation the chapter
of her book in which she testifies to the
value of the service of the Boston public
library to her. It gives me very great
pleasure to introduce to you MARY
ANTIN, who will talk to you on</p>

<h2>THE IMMIGRANT IN THE LIBRARY</h2>


<p>It is very difficult to be interesting or
impressive while telling people things that
they already know. I won't try to do that.
Any one of you sitting in this audience
could tell me a great deal more about the
immigrant in the library than I can possibly
tell you. What I am going to do is to
ask you to have in mind what you know
about the immigrant, to call up the figure
of the immigrant in your libraries as you
have seen him daily, and test by your
knowledge what I have to say.</p>

<p>You know better than I do in what
numbers the immigrants come to your libraries,
how much of their time they spend
there, what books they seek there. What
I want to ask you is to share your knowledge
of these things with as many people
as possible; tell your neighbors every time
you have a chance what the immigrant
does in the library. Every little while we
begin anew the discussion of the immigrant&mdash;to
let him in, or not to let him in&mdash;and
all sorts of arguments are presented
on both sides. Representatives of various
organizations&mdash;capitalistic, unionistic or
what-not&mdash;hurry their advocates to Congress
to speak for or against, on this side
and on that side. I want to ask you to
see to it that the knowledge that you have
of the immigrant is also widely spread on
such occasions. The caricaturist is always
ready with his pencil to give us pictures of
the immigrant in various amusing poses&mdash;more
or less true, more or less false; the
interesting author of the comic paragraph
is always there; the artist of the vaudeville
stage, and enthusiasts of one sort and another&mdash;enemies
or friends of the immigrant&mdash;are
ready to speak up whenever the
question comes up. <span class="sans">You</span> have a fund of
knowledge on the subject which is very
special, very different. Bring it out on
every occasion! When the gentlemen in
Congress want to pass a law to hold up
the immigrant at the gate because he cannot
read fifty lines of our Constitution, say
to them, "Hold! Wait and see what the
immigrant's boys and girls will read when
they are let loose in a public library." Remind
them that the ability to read is not
in itself a test of intellectuality. You know
scores, hundreds of boys and girls of educated,
cultured American families who do
not take such an interest in your libraries
as the boys and girls of these illiterate
immigrants. You know what you know.
Please tell it so loudly that every one
may hear. Talk about the "five-foot shelf
of classics"! Is it not true that the boys
and girls of the immigrants swallow it
whole and make no boast about it? Why,
they are saturated with the classics the
minute they get a chance. The mere ability
to read&mdash;what does that amount to?
You know what book the immigrant calls
for. Every little while I read a short
paragraph in the New York papers telling
that the East Side branches of the public
library have the greatest circulation of the
classics. I would like to see those little
paragraphs enlarged, printed big and
spread where everybody can see them. We
need to know these things.</p>

<p>Please let me speak today as an American,
and not as an immigrant. I wish I
could efface from your memory this once
the knowledge of my origin. Don't make
allowances for what I say because of what
I was. I am not speaking as an immigrant
making an appeal for the immigrants. I am
speaking to you as an American. My credentials
are these: I have been with you
nearly twenty years. My father was an
Americanized citizen before I got here and
I married a native American. Please accept
me as an American today. Let me
speak as one of yourselves.</p>

<p>We are so ready to classify people by
externals&mdash;by their habits, their customs,
by the way they dress, by their gestures.
Why, a better test of a man than the way
in which he makes a living is the way in
which he spends his leisure; and to that
you can testify in the case of the immigrant.
To gain our bread and butter we
are forced to do this, that, and the other
thing. But nobody drives us into the public
library if the saloon is across the way.
Speak up and tell to which door the im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>migrant
turns in his leisure hours. People
of dainty habits are disgusted with the
personal habits of the poor foreigners.
They have noticed a smell of herring and
onions in the East Side of New York.
The smell of onions, my friends, can be
driven out, but a mean habit of mind is
harder to eradicate. Many gentlemen who
feast daintily on caviar content themselves
with the sensational newspaper or the
trashy novel. Are they superior to the
hired laborers who feast on boiled potatoes
and herring and onions and have a
volume of the classics propped up before
them while they eat? There are people
who object to the uncouth manners of the
alien. It would do us good to make a
study of the natural history of the personal
habits of the immigrants. There is
a reason for the shrug of the shoulders, for
the gestures that are so easily caricatured.
They have a history, way back, that it
would do us good to realize.</p>

<p>You workers in the libraries, you see the
immigrant in hundreds, you see him off
guard; for a man in his hours of relaxation
is not posing; you see the alien as
he is at least on one side of his nature.
Let your neighbors know what you know
about the immigrant. Whenever testimony
is being taken on the subject, let your
voice be as loud as any. Almost every day
you will read in your favorite paper letters
to the editor, about "the immigrant peril";
how the foreigners lower our standard of
life, demoralize our habits, spoil the manners
of our children in the public schools.
Some of these things are true, to a certain
extent. But you, under whose observation
the immigrant comes, and the immigrant's
children, ought to be ready with
an explanation of many of these things,
and you ought to be ready to suggest a
remedy. You know what kind of homes
these immigrant children come from, and
that explains a great deal. You sit there
and agree with me, I can see by your faces.
You nod and you smile and you turn to one
another, as much as to say, "That is so."
Don't tell it to me! I know it!! Tell it to
those who do not know it.</p>

<p>A few days ago I received a delegation
of boys and girls from the nearest village
high school. They represented the debating
clubs of their school. They were preparing
a debate on the subject of immigration,
and who could help them except I?
We talked very earnestly for about an hour
at my fireside about this perennial question,
and these young people took me at my
word and were very much in earnest about
what I had to say and in the way in which
they received what I had to say. That is
all right. As a subject for discussion in
the high schools that question may be made
immortal, but as a subject for national agitation
it ought to be laid at rest. Why is
it that certain questions have been settled
once and for all and others are always being
reopened? Those questions are settled
finally which are considered in relation to
their underlying principles. Let us not
confine ourselves to the superficial aspect
of the immigration question.</p>

<p>Every once in a while, when we come to
moralize about these immigrants&mdash;there
are too many of them, they come from the
wrong quarters of the globe, and what not&mdash;let
us ask ourselves, Is that the real
thing that concerns us, or is there something
at the bottom of this agitation that
ought to receive attention first? Are we
really afraid that the immigrant is going
to take the bread from our mouths? If
so, let us stop and think about it. It is the
law of nature that the best man shall come
out ahead. Are we going to stop the immigrant
by temporarily locking the door,
while we have possession of the key? It
will not be for long. Right to the end it is
going to be a struggle between the better
and the worse, and the better will get
ahead. We need not be afraid that the
immigrants will take the bread from our
mouths if we see to it that we are equally
able or better able than they to earn our
bread. It is said they are taking the earth
from under our feet. Not if we are strong
enough to stand and hold our ground. If
they are getting the better of us, it is because
they are better than we, or else, if
that is not so, then they can not be getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
the better of us, and we need not be afraid
of them.</p>

<p>We will never settle this question until
we are willing to consider it along fundamental
lines. Did our forefathers, when
they launched the declaration that all
men were created free and equal, refer to
the few hundreds or few thousands of people
who were then in this country? Why,
in that case, many of you are here only
as guests! Was there any thought in
their minds that of all the people in
the world, those who happened to get in
here before they set to work to compose
the Declaration of Independence were the
ones who were born free and equal, and
with equal opportunities, and all the rest
of mankind with limitations? You heartily
approve the sentiments expressed in our
Constitution and our Declaration of Independence.
How then can you limit the application
of their principles? When did
the day dawn when it was time to shut the
gate? When did the hour arrive when we
could say that all those of free and equal
origin were already here and the rest could
stay outside? I don't know at what moment
immigrants begin to be immigrants
and not pilgrims and voyagers for spiritual
freedom.</p>

<p>People were surprised at a phrase I
used not long ago, and quoted it right and
left, as if I had made a great discovery,
when I said that every ship that brings
over the immigrants is another Mayflower.
Why, I can not think of it in any other
terms. Ships are now made to run with
steam instead of with sails, and our forefathers
did not come in the steerage because
the Mayflower wasn't built that way.</p>

<p>You see I am not sticking to my text&mdash;a
proof of an inexperienced speaker. But
I am not a speaker. I am a witness on
the witness stand. I have been called
from the ranks to testify. Now each of
you is in the same position. It would have
been an impertinence on my part to get up
before a body of scholars without a finished
address, if I had any idea that I was
going to make an intellectual contribution.
I simply answer to my name as a witness,
and each of you can do no less: testify to
what you know. Now remember I am not
asking this for the sake of the immigrant.
If this were the proper time and place I
would tell you just how, in what order,
my interest in the immigrant on the one
hand and in America on the other developed.
With me it was America first, and
it still is so. I was not conscious of the
immigrant as a special class of our citizenship
until I became conscious of certain
American problems. It is with me the
immigrant for the sake of America, not
America for the sake of the immigrant,
and I beg you to believe me. And why
do I insist that all the truth you know
about the immigrant shall be brought out?
I am not speaking&mdash;I can not repeat it
emphatically enough&mdash;because I am an immigrant,
not even because I represent that
specially large group of immigrants, the
Jews. If America should go back on its
ancient traditions and close its hospitable
doors, the Jews would suffer bitterly. But
what is one more disappointment in the
history of the Jews? They have known
how to lift up their hearts and thank God
for disappointments before. They would
simply adopt another dream. It is not for
them that I speak. Nor is it because I
am a great lover of justice. I want to see
that justice is done to the stranger, to be
sure; let us know all sides of the immigrant
that no injustice may be done. But
the thing that makes me speak to you
more than any other is my love for America,
for the ideals that I was taught to
cherish in the public school. I took everything
in my school books literally; when
I read that this is the land of freedom;
that the door is open to all worthy men
and women, and that all shall have an
equal opportunity. I want to hold you to
that, to a literal interpretation of those
terms.</p>

<p>I went back to Russia two years ago, to
Polotzk on the Dvina, the city in the Pale
where I was born, and again I felt as I
felt in the beginning, when I first came
here, after seeing how those people over
there regard us. They still take us at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
our word. When we turn them away at
the gate, for this and that petty excuse
at the bottom of which is some selfish motive
that we do not dare to acknowledge,
they are bitterly disappointed. And yet
they are not the worst sufferers. It is we
who suffer, we as Americans, for in turning
them away we abandon our ideals, and
lose the consciousness that we are still
conserving the ideals of our forefathers.
It always seems to me that in our attitude
towards the immigrant, more than in any
other branch of our national policy, we
make manifest our true ideals. In our
formal dealings with foreign governments
we may make blunders, we may betray
weaknesses, but on the whole these matters
remain a secret with the foreign ambassador.
The people at large do not follow
very closely these dignified negotiations
about treaties and tariff and what-not; but
as we meet these individual men and
women at the gate, here we give ourselves
away. There, at the gate of entrance, we,
the people of America, deal directly with
the people of the world. The immigrant
with his million eyes is looking at us,
and he will tell whether or not we still
believe in the things for which we honor
our forefathers on all our patriotic anniversaries.</p>

<p>There was a young Jewish girl working
in my household as a cook, who had been
through very unhappy experiences in this
country, experiences which, unfortunately,
have been multiplied in the lives of many
other girls who come here unprotected.
She told me her story once, and I saw that
what hurt her more than her own misfortunes,
more than the agony she had been
through, more than the disgrace she had
suffered, was her disappointment in America.
She found that in America, in this
instance that she knew of in her own life,
a man may do a gross wrong and there
is no way to get hold of him and punish
him. She had times of discouragement
when she would talk to me and complain
of that thing. Oh, it shook me to find that
in the mind of this ignorant, illiterate
child of seventeen, we, the American people,
had lost something of our prestige.
I talked to her&mdash;perhaps the need inspired
me&mdash;and explained to her that our laws,
like the laws of civilization at large, are
not yet perfect; that law and civilization
are things of gradual growth; and showed
her that although we are still to blame
for many things that here exist, we have
done far better than other people in some
respects. I made it my business to try to
prove to this ignorant Russian girl, my
cook, who waited on me every day, that
America was still America, despite some
mistakes and some failings, and that, on
the whole, we have gone further in the
quest of justice than other nations. It
mattered to me that this one girl should
think we were still Americans, and surely
it matters to you just as much.</p>

<p>Do not let these millions that come to
our gates get the wrong impression of
us. Do not let people with selfish interests
to serve, who send representatives to
Congress, speak louder than you do when
this question comes to be discussed. Let
the truth out every time. For the sake
of our country I am asking it, not for the
sake of the unfortunate foreigners. We
owe them something, as a people of charitable
heart, to be sure, but we owe more
to ourselves and to our traditions.</p>

<p>This same girl of whom I speak also afforded
an illustration of some of the nobler
traits of many of our immigrants that you
are aware of, and that you ought to testify
to. I mean the reverence for learning that
is found among the ignorant, the illiterate,
of many of our immigrants. This girl who
could not read or write a word in any
language until she came to me (when
gradually, by means of the cook-book, she
made some progress), had a genuine reverence
for learning, which is in itself
half of the material for making a scholar.
I kept her pretty busy in my household,
as I usually do keep our maids, and sometimes,
when there would be a rush of more
work than I could do, I would put her to
extra trouble, to bring my luncheon upstairs,
perhaps, when I could not stop for
meals. "Oh, Miss Antin," she used to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
"it is wonderful that I can wait on somebody
who can write books!" A respect
for letters such as this is not one of our
prominent characteristics as Americans.
I ought to have the courage of our foreign
visitor, who told the truth about his people.
I can do no less. We can not boast
of too much reverence for learning. Is it
not a great asset these foreigners bring
with them, this reverence for learning?
The man behind the pushcart can't read
fifty lines of the Constitution, but his heart
bows in reverence before the man who can,
and that is worth more than the ability
to read the Constitution and forget it.</p>

<p>There are so many ways of classifying
the immigrants&mdash;as laborers, as a peril, as
a help, according to one's point of view.
But I always think of them as a cloud of
witnesses in the tribunal of the nations.
They go back and forth, in person or
through letters; their experience is reported
all over the world, and they tell
the truth about us. The immigrant is the
only visitor, you know, who comes to stay
and finds us out. The tourists, the critics,
the honorable guests of various honorable
institutions, who are taken around in carriages
and shown our best front, what do
they know about us? The letters home
that go out from the East Side, shiploads of
letters, some of them written at dictation,
sent by persons who cannot write themselves&mdash;(I
used to write letters for my
cook; I have never forgotten some of
them)&mdash;those are the documents that go all
over the world. They are forming their
opinion of us in the far corners of the
earth. What shall they say of us?</p>

<p>If you see that justice is done in the case
of the immigrant, they will have no evil to
say of us. Our traditions of liberty, of hospitality
to the oppressed, will be realized
in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>Now it does not matter that the immigrants
today may not be running away
from religious oppression, or may not be
victims of political martyrdom. Martyrdom
of the worst kind is martyrdom of
the spirit, and immigrants who have suffered
such martyrdom are still coming to
us by the shipload. It is accurate to say,
in a certain way, that the immigrants in
the beginning came in search of liberty,
and today they come in search of bread.
That may all be, but with most of our
present-day immigrants, if you give them
bread and nothing else, they are not satisfied.
You know it. And I know what the
people said in Polotzk only two years ago.
If any of you thought, from reading my
story, that I had put down the reminiscences
of my early childhood, with the haze of
the past over all, that I had idealized everything
in my enthusiasm, I can assure you
that while my story was in manuscript I
went back to Polotzk, to find out if I had
told the truth, and I found that I had. I
found there my old rabbi, my teacher who
taught me my Hebrew letters. I talked
with various of the old scholars, who were
very old when I got back after seventeen
years' absence&mdash;these old men who spend
their time over the Talmud in the corridors
of the synagogues&mdash;and I found
among them just that attitude toward
America which I remembered to have existed
when I came away nearly twenty
years ago. They look on us today as on
the upholders of justice and true liberty.
They still believe in us.</p>

<p>Do not let them lose that faith! It is
more to us than it is to them that they
shall be satisfied in their high longings.
That is all I ask of you. You know the
immigrant as he is in the library; you have
a view of him that most people have not.
You send your little paragraphs to the New
York papers. They are not printed big
enough. Nobody sees them. Speak up
and tell what you know about the immigrant,
that justice may be done, that we
may remain sound-headed and true-hearted
in our national life, true to our traditions;
and the immigrant will hear with a million
ears and see with a million eyes and
run with a million feet to the far corners
of the earth, to cry that America is still
America.</p>

<p>The FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT: I shall
ask you to rise as an expression of thanks
and appreciation of Miss Antin's address.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
(The audience remained standing for a
moment.)</p>

<p>The next speaker will discuss the subject
of immigrants as contributors to library
progress. It gives me very great pleasure
to introduce to you Mrs. ADELAIDE
B. MALTBY, who is in charge of the
Tompkins Square branch, on the lower
East Side, of the New York public library.</p>

<h2>IMMIGRANTS AS CONTRIBUTORS TO
LIBRARY PROGRESS</h2>


<p>I should prefer to let Miss Antin's personality
and accomplishments bear home
to you the point I had hoped to make; and
silently let what she has said to us possess
our imaginations to the end that our
interest and will-to-do will be vigorously
stirred. Fortunately, this will happen in
spite of my words.</p>

<p>A little girl with a fairy book in her
hand gleefully remarked: "I can tell what
kind of stories are in the book by the continents."
Would that we could so tell the
stories of our peoples! Yet the story of
immigrants in this country is not unlike
that of the "Ugly Duckling;" and Miss
Antin is living proof of the swan-like
qualities. We, as a nation, have persisted
in hatching the odd egg; have been apparently
proud of the duckling's ability to
swim untaught, like other ducks; and were
duly troubled, when because of his unlikeness,
he was not acceptable to closer acquaintance
with cock and gander in the
barn-yard. We have witnessed, with but
feeble protest, his struggle to feel at home,
his association with wild ducks and all it
entailed. It seems as if the winter of his
agony is enduring. He's had a stirring
within as of something better to come!
The question is will we make greater effort
to recognize the swan-like qualities
and to give freedom for their development?
In this direction lies progress.</p>

<p>As contributors, I shall not single out
great personalities from among our foreigners.
They will belong to history. Nor
do I mean only the well educated groups.
They are generally accorded recognition.
But I do name the masses who earn just
consideration slowly.</p>

<p>First of all, immigrants have kept us
alive in every generation. Shall we say
on the "qui vive" in some localities? All
agree that living is no minor art, so to
stimulate life is a contribution. Frank
Warne in his book, the "Immigrant Invasion,"
tells how the distribution of immigrants
previous to our civil war practically
determined the outcome of that struggle,
by giving to the North balance of power
in Congress because of larger population,
which was made up of able-bodied men
who replaced Federal soldiers and kept
shops and farms going to furnish supplies
to the army. It is interesting to note that
Mr. Warne ascribes the trend of immigration
to the north and west very largely to
what was read in the old countries about
life in different parts of America, mentioning
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" as the one
product of literature most influencing distribution.</p>

<p>Cold statistics tell us that New York,
Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
Illinois and California have the greatest
number of foreign born. With this as a
basic fact we naturally suppose that in
these states, at least, public libraries will
be found catering to and helping to Americanize
and to educate these citizens-to-be;
because, if for no other reason, we proudly
call ourselves the "university of the people."
If the truth were told through questionnaire,
or otherwise, about twenty-five
out of one hundred libraries throughout
New York state are sufficiently alive to the
problem to supply books to attract and interest
foreigners. Yet for twenty years,
at least, the task of assimilating the almost
overwhelming influx of immigrants
has been acute in the states named and in
many localities elsewhere. A gentleman
working for the education of foreigners in
American ways has said that he thought
libraries seemed most indifferent to their
opportunities. While another, a foreigner,
devoting himself and two fortunes to bettering
conditions for immigrants, thinks
that public libraries, when they do work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
sympathetically&mdash;I mean that in the broadest
sense&mdash;with the foreign born are the
only organizations which accomplish with
real altruism the implanting of American
ideals and the developing of better citizens.
This, he believes, is done when we
appreciate and build on the natural endowment
of the individual or race.</p>

<p>Since the national government has been
facing this stupendous problem, commissions
and organizations galore, official and
philanthropic, have sprung into existence
as aids. So many are there in New York
City alone, a possible list would bewilder
one! Yet in how many reports of such
work when educational assets of communities
are being cited, is there mention made
of libraries as a force in educating the immigrant?
Through libraries, however,
more than through most educational
agencies may self-expression and development
of natural gifts be realized by individuals
of all ages and nationalities. Where
does the trouble lie? Have we been open-minded
or eager enough to discover the excellent
contributions foreigners bring to
the end that we respond to live issues, thus
building progressively?</p>

<p>Old habits can be changed to new compunctions.
There is no standardized method
of discovering or of spiritualizing men,
of holding intercourse with aliens or of
receiving what they bring; but we can
develop sympathy and understanding, by
knowing the people as individuals, their
countries, literatures, languages, arts,
great national characters&mdash;in a word, their
histories, even to economic conditions.
Thereby do we come to an understanding
of reasons for immigration of the present
day and of aspirations for life here. Thus
equipped mentally for further sympathetic
appreciation, first hand observation of conditions
will help; or if that is not possible,
an imaginative putting ourselves in the immigrants'
places from the time they leave
their old world homes with all their worldly
goods in their hands and, in spite of
homesickness and fears, with courage and
hope in their hearts&mdash;with them as they
exist in their steerage quarters and with
them when they pass through the portals
and mazes of Ellis Island, in the main uncomprehendingly
but always trustfully. I
can not attempt here to draw the detailed
picture; but if you cannot see it for yourself,
Mr. Edward Steiner gives it graphically
and faithfully in his "On the Trail of
the Immigrant." At last, the Federal government
accessions the immigrant. He is
passed on, properly numbered, to be shelf-listed
by states, cities and towns, coming
finally to libraries and other institutions
to be cataloged. It remains to us then to
decide for our own work whether there
shall be one entry under the word "alien"
or whether his various assets shall be
made available by analytical entries.</p>

<p>Somewhat of all this we must know to
appreciate what the immigrant can contribute
to life here, and to library progress,
if we are wise enough to call it forth or
make opportunity for its expression. It is
vain to hope for the assimilation of the
alien as a result of conscious benevolent
effort. We too often forget that each of
the hundreds of thousands is a human being!
With a sense of the finest they can
bring with them, we should have an increasing
knowledge of how they live here,
what they think and how these elements
can be influenced by books and personal
contact. The pressure of a congested neighborhood
goads to thoughtful search for
remedies.</p>

<p>No one will go far along these paths
without realizing how avid libraries must
be to reap the benefits of such diverse
gifts, rather than to suffer from the dregs.
We must correlate books and people as
never before to attain progress.</p>

<p>"If we once admit the human, dynamic
character of progress, then it is easy to
understand why the crowded city quarters
become focal points of that progress." As
an earnest of what is being done in many
libraries elsewhere, may I tell of our work
in New York, of that only because I know
it best. What has been done in one place
and more, can be done in another through
interest, desire and adaptation.</p>

<p>The necessity of having the library near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the people for whom its use is intended is,
of course, recognized. This is more especially
true when the people are foreigners.
The New York public library has
forty-one branches and all that are located
in districts where foreigners live have, beside
English books, collections of books
in languages native to the residents. By
so doing we believe that we convince of
our friendship those adults who do not
and even those who may never read English.
This is a fundamental necessity, opening
up various possibilities for imparting
American ideas and ideals. The less
English the grown people read the more
they need knowledge of true American
ideas to help keep them in touch with
their children, who rapidly take on ways
and manners strange to their parents,
many of whom are uncomprehending, reticent
and often sad. We go still further.
We have assistants of the nationalities
represented in the neighborhood, whose
special duty it is to make known to their
peoples the library privileges, also to
know their people individually as far as
possible and, of course, the books. Right
here may I say that a foreign born assistant
imbued with respect for her own countrymen
and with true American ideals can
in her enthusiasm do more to make real
citizens than many Americans. This cannot
be accomplished if, as happens with
so many young foreigners, their own people
as we see them in this country, are
held in contempt. It were pity to scorn
the strong qualities they possess, these
"Greenies," as they call themselves. They
live daily too close to the vital facts of
existence to develop self-consciousness or
artificialities to any great extent. We talk
of simplicity. They have it. Courage, singleness
of purpose, happiness in modest
circumstances and astonishing capacity for
work are elements of everyday life unconsciously
developed. Their wealth of imagination,
fostered by their own folk-lore
and early traditions, could not be more
wonderfully illustrated than it has been
just recently in New York. The majority
of us think of New York and other large
cities as vast factories with the machine-like
and vicious qualities of human nature
uppermost, so it is most refreshing to contemplate
"Old Home Week in Greenwich
Village" and the "Henry Street Pageant."</p>

<p>"Old Home Week" successfully recalled
Greenwich Village history in a dramatic
way to its residents&mdash;American, Irish and
Italian&mdash;and aroused a new sense of fellowship
in sharing the district's activities.</p>

<p>To celebrate the twentieth anniversary
of the Henry Street Settlement, a pictorial
representation of the history of the neighborhood
from the days of the Indians to the
present time was given by its residents&mdash;men,
women and children&mdash;before an assemblage
of spectators from all parts of
the city and representative of all its activities&mdash;civic
and social. The last living picture,
or episode, was of all the nationalities
that have lived in the last fifty years
in Henry Street, once the center of Manhattan's
fashionable life. The Irish, the
Scotch, the Germans, the Italians and the
Russians appeared. They sang the songs
and danced the dances that contribute so
much poetry to the life of the city, while
onlookers marveled at the temperamental
qualities which made it possible for foreigners
to reproduce with unconscious
realism historical scenes of a city and a
country not their own!</p>

<p>Such neighborhood pageants as this and
the celebration in Greenwich Village, exert
a wholesome and a permanent influence
in our municipal life. In both these
events the libraries of the neighborhoods
took part. The library aimed to show that
folk-songs and folk-dances are kept alive
by folk-stories. The contrast between old
New York and the present time was shown
by the use of historical scenes&mdash;lantern
slides&mdash;and a story; in the one case reminiscent
of early Dutch settlers and in
the other a poetic interpreting of the spirit
of service in municipal life. Those planning
the pageant felt that this was a direct
help in making atmosphere or in inducing
an interpretive mood in participants.
Festival occasions like these bind
together by national ties the people and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
institutions of a neighborhood and are rich
with possibilities for the library. To a delightful
degree they broaden our understanding
of the folk-spirit.</p>

<p>So it seems natural to have stories in the
library told by foreigners in their native
tongues. From time to time we have
groups of Bohemians, Germans, Hungarians,
Italians listening to old world traditions
and tales. Knowing the original
and the translation enhances the value of
the story in English for narrator and listeners.
Through these story hours we are
reminding the foreigner of his unique contribution
to life here, and are showing
our respect for his best. For a simple
example, our picture books and book illustration
in general do not express life as
vividly or realistically as Russian, Bohemian
or Swedish artists do. Having some
of these in our juvenile collections has
been a distinct contribution to establishing
sympathetic relations with foreigners.</p>

<p>Yes, it is true that the Italian laborer
loves Dante and Italian classics. It is
relatively true of other nationalities. If
we take for granted that we should know
and libraries should have, French and German
standard writers&mdash;and this largely
because their literature is older, more
translated or their languages better known&mdash;may
we not also take for granted that
literary history is still in the making?
Should we not bestir ourselves to know
latter-day masterpieces, if such there be,
and the older literature which has helped
mould or inspire writers of them, in Swedish,
Finnish, Bohemian, Polish, Hungarian
or any other language spoken by the people
surrounding us? Perhaps the need of
realizing what these literary contributions
may mean can be emphasized by the fact
that in one week, June 2 to June 9, 1913,
thirty thousand souls, nearly five thousand
daily, passed the man at the Eastern gateway.
Eighty per cent or thereabouts are
going beyond New York City these days.</p>

<p>Is the Hungarian's enjoyment of Jokai
or their patriot poets for Hungarians
alone? One can better appreciate how to
sustain effort and enthusiasm in a person
or a group of this nationality if one knows
that much of their best poetry came almost
from the cannon's mouth on the field of
battle; and if one has seen the glistening
eyes and heard the voices of kerchief-capped
girls and boys in trousers to shoe
tops as they sang in ringing tones "Esk&uuml;sz&uuml;nk!"
and then heard their national song
in English for the first time. At home
they may not celebrate their Independence
Day, March 15; but when they are invited
to, here, in the library, they do it with
much genuine feeling and true sentiment,
which I believe leads them to appreciate
and adopt as their own our Independence
Day. Through such as they, perhaps, patriotic
sentiment and feeling may once
more be evident in our Fourth of July celebrations.</p>

<p>If we try to think of a library without
the contributions of writers of other nationalities,
we must face almost empty
shelves in some classes of knowledge. This
makes us realize more clearly that immigrants
have rich possessions by right of inheritance
while these are ours only by
adoption. Some of the newcomers to our
shores may have lost their heritage temporarily;
but they will warmly cherish as
a friend the library that restores to them
this valuable possession and for us that
friendship is preeminently a contribution.</p>

<p>There are other special ways in which
the library seems happily successful in
forming such friendships. With adults it
comes through our co-operation with neighborhood
associations, or organizations
working for the benefit of foreigners, such
as the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. who
conduct in our lecture rooms classes to
teach English to foreigners. In these instances
it is our pleasure to supplement
with books the copies treated. The book
work is, perhaps, most marked in connection
with the English classes where we
have opportunity to watch progress and
needs of the individual more carefully
from the time when an eager pupil may
ask, as one did, for a book called a "Woman's
Tongue" wanting Arnold's "Mother
Tongue" to his reading of Hale's "Man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
without a country," perhaps, or Andrews'
"The perfect tribute." There are also many
semi-social, semi-educational clubs, or associations,
which hold their meetings in
the libraries. The Slavia is a Bohemian
club, which has as its only meeting place
the Bohemian department of one of our
branches. Its members have done much to
help form a splendid Bohemian library.
Several Hungarian associations work in
co-operation with three branches, where
are collections of Hungarian books. A
large Polish society gives its educational
lectures twice a month in one branch and
its advice in the selection of books; but
perhaps the "German Association for Culture"
best illustrates my point. They
state: "We are working for culture, and
we aim to give the Germans in America
and the Americans a better understanding
of our contemporary German literature
and art. We are bending our efforts more
particularly for our members who as artists,
poets, writers, etc., are producing valuable
works. And we want to help as
much as possible those talented artists,
poets, etc., who are not yet known." Their
distinction is that they succeed! Even in
the et ceteras!</p>

<p>As concrete instances of other possible
contributions by foreigners to library progress,
I want to tell of the discussion of
one City History Club chapter and the action
of a settlement organization. The
membership in both is composed of foreign-born
young men from sixteen to twenty
years of age, and both groups interest
themselves in present day civic welfare.
The Settlement Club wrote to the mayor,
comptroller, library trustees and several
daily papers a dignified plea for increase
in library appropriation and in salaries.
The year's closing meeting of a certain
City History Club was a discussion of the
city budget, the club members representing
New York's mayor, aldermen and
comptroller. The main contention of the
majority was that cutting the appropriation
of the public library meant seriously
handicapping one of the city's most efficient
servants and they ended with a warm
appreciation of service rendered by library
assistants and a vigorous plea for better
salaries. This was later reproduced for
an audience of representative citizens by
the City History Club as a token typical
of their work. Both these happenings came
as complete surprises to librarians. It
seems as if in their eagerness to "get on"
young foreigners, especially, seek and use
every possible public means for advancement.
They soon appreciate what good
service means and how to get it. They
make us feel toward what ends they are
tending and suggest definitely our part in
the building for civic betterment.</p>

<p>To sum up, immigrants do bring very
rich contributions in arts and literature.
They bring many capabilities, that of acquiring
intellectual cultivation being not
the least among them. I am not blind to
the seriousness of the problems they create,
having worked among them about ten
years; but the conviction strengthens that
knowing and understanding their racial
and social inheritance and first hand contact
with groups of individuals stimulate
to broader thought and living. It is not
an argument! It is a suggestive statement!
Immigrants can contribute to library
progress.</p>

<h2>THE MAN IN THE YARDS</h2>


<p>This great country of ours has become
within the last century a huge "melting
pot" for all the nations of the world. Foreign
and English speaking tongues from
the four corners of the earth have sought
our shores as a haven of relief and opportunity.
No other nation has experienced
a like growth and none other has ever
gained the changing cosmopolitan characteristics
which have come to us from such
widely differing component parts. Those
of us who call ourselves Americans owe
our life, liberty and happiness to the conditions
which brought about this great
growth and upon us devolves the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
burden of relieving many of the unfortunate
conditions which naturally result
from the continued and increasing wave of
humanity still seeking better things in our
so-called land of freedom and equality.</p>

<p>During the past ninety years nearly thirty
millions of people have entered our immigration
gates, adding to our numbers more
inhabitants than the total population of the
United States three score years ago, and
almost one-third of our present total figure.
At the close of the year of 1912 the
total and combined population of five
states of the Union did not equal the number
of immigrants admitted during the preceding
twelve months. Eighty per cent of
these thirty millions arrived during the
last fifty years. Eighty-seven per cent of
them were more than fourteen years of
age, while only thirteen per cent were under
fourteen. These figures easily demonstrate
that the problem is a growing one
and that the large proportion of new arrivals
are destined to become citizens and
parents of future citizens in a short time.
Our past policy of devoting our greatest efforts
to the thirteen per cent while largely
neglecting the eighty-seven per cent seems
very similar to the losing method of mending
a leaking boat by removing the water
with a sponge rather than by repairing the
hole.</p>

<p>Economists tell us that the "rise and fall
of the immigration waves are very closely
connected with the phenomenon of prosperity
in this country," and that the general
causes of westward expansion lie in
the presence of foreign political and religious
persecutions, low wages, bad economic
conditions, ease of transportation,
inflated rumors of great opportunities in
America, and the appeal of separated
friends and relatives.</p>

<p>The early immigrants, being largely of
Teutonic and Keltic origin, were thrifty
and self-reliant by nature and entered our
American life as skilled workmen in agriculture
and in the trades. In the last quarter
of a century the source of the tide has
changed from the northern to the southern
countries, resulting in a far different
type of foreigner who is generally unskilled,
lacking independence and initiative,
and blindly submissive to authority.
Many come from nations with a per cent. of
illiteracy rising as high as seventy, and
notwithstanding the fifty per cent decrease
in the total percentage of illiteracy in this
country during the past thirty years we
must face the fact that some twenty-eight
out of every one hundred of the new arrivals
over fourteen years of age are annually
classed as illiterates. In the future
we may expect to receive an increasing
flood of immigration from China, Japan
and India, with problems and conditions
even more perplexing.</p>

<p>Some say that the incoming foreigner
directly affects the entire laboring class
native to America in that he adds materially
to the supply of wage earners, lowers
the scale of wages due to lower standards
of living, changes working conditions
through the subdivision of labor, modifies
labor organizations, influences local and
national politics and increases social difficulties.
It has been said that "low standards
of living on the part of unskilled
workers menace the higher standards of
the skilled workers. The man of skill is
recognizing this fact and he is frequently
found joining hands with the unskilled to
right the grievances of the latter. In the
cotton mills, in the meat packing industry,
in the coal mines, in the clothing industry
and elsewhere, one nationality has been
displaced by another satisfied with a lower
standard of living. In turn the second has
been displaced by a third, and so on. Wave
after wave of immigrants may be traced
in the history of one of these industries.
As rapidly as a race rises in the scale of
living, and through organization begins to
demand higher wages and to resist the
pressure of long hours and over-exertion,
the employers substitute another race and
the process is repeated. Each race comes
from a country lower in the scale than
that of the preceding until finally the ends
of the earth have been ransacked in the
search for low standards of living com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>bined
with patient industriousness." (Carlton).</p>

<p>Our civilization cannot remain unaffected
by these changing characteristics
and the threatening, industrial conditions
confronting us. With the army of the unemployed
rapidly growing larger and larger,
it behooves the American nation to
encourage immediate consideration of
ways and means to prevent unfortunate results
in our industrial, political and social
life.</p>

<p>The national government, being concerned
chiefly with the admission or rejection
of the immigrant, quickly places
him under the care of state and local governments,
who are duty-bound to assume
the entire responsibility of developing him
into an efficient worker and a good citizen.
The regulation of private employment
agencies, protection of the foreigner in
transit, adoption of standard employment
laws, creation of municipal unemployment
commissions, etc., indicate that state and
city governments are beginning to respond
to this duty of offering more sympathetic
understanding, more adequate care and
better protection to the newly arrived, confused,
unemployed and homeless immigrant.
These governments are slowly realizing
that their obligations have been sorely
neglected in the past when such problems
were wholly consigned to the well
meaning but quite inadequate field of private
philanthropy. Public libraries, as departments
of city governments, concerned
with the dissemination of knowledge of the
masses, must soon realize their large responsibility
in the naturalization, education
and socialization of our foreign born
population. It is very gratifying to announce
that the state of Massachusetts has
very recently taken the lead in this particular
field of service by the passage of an
act authorizing the appointment by the
Board of library commissioners of a field
worker to direct the educational work of
libraries among the aliens of the state.</p>

<p>Libraries, like human beings, can reach
a high point of efficiency and service in
a particular line only when that line is
encouraged and promoted. The development
of libraries favoring certain classes
of citizens has been quite general and extremely
successful. Much has been said but
comparatively little has been done for the
foreigner among our laboring men. The
"man in the yards," the unskilled foreign
wage-earner, being taxed, while needing
more and receiving less from society than
others, "has done much of the rough and
hard work of recent decades. He has built
the roadbeds of our railways, mined our
coal and iron, unloaded our vessels, and
cleaned our streets. The recent immigrant
has performed the crude manual labor necessary
for the upbuilding of big industrial
plants and huge transportation systems.
His services in developing the resources of
the nation have been extremely important.
Many industries would be almost depleted
if divested of all wage-earners of foreign
birth and those born on American soil but
of foreign born parents. If the foreign
born and the native born of foreign parents
were removed from our large cities,
the latter would shrink to approximately
one-third of their recent size." (Carlton.)</p>

<p>This "man in the yards" with whom "intimate
contact removes prejudice, inspires
appreciation and kindles self-respect," displays
an astounding amount of seriousness
and earnestness in his desire to learn and
to improve himself when once informed of
the possibilities in our libraries. Very often
he finds his chief delight in the best of
books, like a child calling for good instead
of new books, and many times he is not as
dull and as ignorant as generally supposed,
being more appreciative of better things
than our average native laboring man.
The opportunity is a great one to be of
practical and inspirational help to an eager
reader seeking to increase his earning
power and joy in life, and to learn of the
higher ideals of citizenship and the coming
brotherhood of all.</p>

<p>In order to devise worth-while methods
of approaching him and securing his interest,
place yourself in imagination in
similar surroundings and conditions on a
foreign shore. Only through direct appeals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
touching your personal needs, pleasure and
occupation would you be attracted in like
circumstances by strangers. The same is
true with our new Americans.</p>

<p>Foreigners who speak the same language
largely settle in the same locality
and move from place to place in groups.
A thorough educational survey of these
groups in the community tributary to the
library or branch is of first importance to
determine the characteristics, conditions
and needs of each group. Whenever it is
possible an experienced library and social
worker should be employed. The advice
and assistance of factory managers, labor
leaders and social workers cannot be valued
too highly. Following these steps
branch and deposit stations administered
by local assistants may well be located in
favorable shops, yards, factories, settlements,
centers, and labor headquarters,
without arousing undue suspicion among
the men, even more extensively than in
many of our progressive library systems
today.</p>

<p>The formation of the recently named
"Creative" or "Extension" departments
and the appointment of one or more
trained assistants to create interest and
regularly visit and supervise the library
work in each district, group and institution
will soon become a customary feature in
the large cities. I firmly believe that it
will not be many years until our large
manufacturing institutions employing
much labor will construct recreational centers
in their plants equipped with social,
reading and gymnastic departments sufficient
to meet the needs of their employees.
Furthermore, I see little to discourage
the establishment of traveling library
collections on wheels, visiting certain districts
on scheduled time, after the manner
of the now famous Maryland wagon and
automobile. In libraries near foreign centers
special departments are needed to
supply practical and simple information
in different languages on requirements for
naturalization, instruction, employment,
investments, American customs, travel and
history, demands of law and order, American
money and banks, and friendly advice
on many things of fifty-seven or more
varieties.</p>

<p>The development of our present line of
tactics, including the presentation of lectures
emphasizing the possibility of increased
wages through practical reading,
the formation of classes in the study of
English, the promotion of special foreign
entertainment programs and exhibitions,
the extension of the library habit to adults
through publicity directed to their children,
the publication of daily news for
workers by means of special library papers
and the general press, the creation of
more effectively printed library advertising
done in many languages, the co-operation
with individuals and societies promoting
educational, social and recreation centers,
etc., will open a new era in library
service for foreign laboring men.</p>

<p>A great number of specialized and technical
industrial books may not often be
found necessary in library collections, since
the great need among this class of readers
is a large supply of trade journals and
more elementary mechanical books for the
unskilled workman, the student mechanic
and the future tradesman.</p>

<p>On the other hand life as well as livelihood
must be considered and met. All
men must live while they are earning a
living and in these days they must be
trained for vacation as well as vocation.
The tendency today is to place too much
emphasis on the daily struggle for livelihood
and to neglect the hours of life during
leisure time. In defense of the "man
in the yards" the crying answer returns,
"but what of the man whose soul-deadening
toil leaves little or no time for leisure
or whose daily labor kills all mental and
physical desire for leisure, rest and improvement."
This cry will return again and
again until all labor shall be so equalized
that all men will have more of what life
offers and less of what it demands. Those
who work on specialized labor done under
intense strain and through long hours are
destined to become weakened, brutalized
and almost incapable of showing intelli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>gent
interest in social-betterment. Even
"family life," the first school of morals, is
a closed book against the man who comes
home dead-tired late at night.</p>

<p>Consider some of the perils through
which the working boy must pass from
year to year, such as economic waste in un-educational
trades, stinted physical development,
early maturity, suppression of the
spirit of boyhood, indifference towards
knowledge and efficiency, personal weakness,
and delinquency. The dire results
due to these perils are well illustrated by
the following replies made by a number
of Chicago factory children when asked
why they quit school:</p>

<p>"Because it's easier to work in a factory
than it is to learn at school."</p>

<p>"You never understand what they tell
you in school and you can learn right off
to do things in a factory."</p>

<p>"They don't call you a Dago."</p>

<p>"You can buy shoes for the baby."</p>

<p>"Our boss he never went to school."</p>

<p>"School ain't no good. The Holy Father
he can send ye to hell, and the boss he
can take yer job away er raise yer pay.
But the teacher, she can't do nothing."</p>

<p>Is it not true that greed, selfishness,
privilege, injustice and neglect are five of
the great sins of civilization? These obstructions
to progress are largely due to
ignorance and indifference, two causes
which are in themselves as great evils
as their results. In order to attain the
best of social conditions, positive cures
must be found for these devastating
evils&mdash;cures that will replace greed
by liberality, selfishness by the brotherhood
of man, privilege by equality,
injustice by justice and neglect by
service&mdash;cures that will transform ignorance
and indifference into clear-eyed
knowledge and active responsibility. Laws
and revolutions have failed more miserably
than we enjoy admitting and only through
the far reaching, beneficent influences of
education and religion may we expect to
touch the roots of these great evils.</p>

<p>Is it possible that many of our public libraries,
who reach the individual and his
family long before and for many years following
the efforts of our public schools,
can consider themselves excused from a
large part of their responsibility in the educational
movements now striving to improve
the physical, mental and moral conditions
of these men who suffer for want
of better things? How can it be that some
librarians stand by indifferently and heed
not the cry of need from these weaker
members of society, who, with their distinctive
and curable social difficulties, have
been left alone to carve their own destinies,
unappreciated and unaided? The
time is near at hand when everyone shall
recognize that it is the "common right of
all men to share in the culture, prosperity
and progress" of society, and that the conservation
of life by raising it to its highest
value is to be the cry of our new era of
heightened individuality.</p>

<p>In his inaugural address President Wilson
uttered these accusing heart searching
words: "We have been proud of our industrial
achievements, but we have not
hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to
count the human cost, the cost of lives
snuffed out, of energies overtaxed and
broken, the fearful physical and spiritual
cost to the men and women and children
upon whom the dead weight and burden of
it all has fallen without mercy the years
through. The groans and agony of it
all, the solemn moving undertone of our
life, coming up out of the mines and factories
and out of every home where the
struggle has had its intimate and familiar
seat, have not yet reached our ears."</p>

<p>The "vision of the open gates of opportunity
for all" must first be seen by
those who lead before they who follow can
dream dreams and go forth to realize
them.</p>

<p>The FIRST VICE-PRESIDENT: The
next speaker, who is now the librarian of
the Rochester public library, was for many
years librarian of one of the most important
libraries south of what Mr. O. Henry
was accustomed to call "Mason &amp; Ham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>lin's
Line." I have the pleasure of introducing
Mr. WILLIAM F. YUST, who will
speak to us on</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>WHAT OF THE BLACK AND YELLOW
RACES?</h2>


<p>The form in which this subject is expressed
is first a question asking for information
which has never before been
collected. Possibly there is in it also a
mild challenge to library authorities calling
for a declaration of purpose and policy.</p>

<p>So far there is no indication of a yellow
race problem in public libraries. When
foreigners enter a field which is already occupied
they do not produce a real race
problem so long as they are so few in number
that they are chiefly objects of curiosity.</p>

<p>It is difficult to understand how the Japanese
can be a serious race problem in
California where they constitute only two
and one-half per cent of the population and
own and lease only twelve one-hundredths
of one per cent of the land. And yet it
sounds as if there is trouble there. Whatever
may be its nature and its causes, the
difficulty has not extended to public libraries.
The Chinese on the Pacific coast,
as elsewhere, are seldom seen in a library.
They live in their own quarter and hardly
ever penetrate other sections of the city
except for purposes of trade.</p>

<p>The Japanese who frequent the libraries
are not numerous. They belong almost
entirely to the student class and the books
they take are used in connection with their
school work. In some places they "appear
to be more resourceful, more polite and
more intelligent than the average high
school student" with whom the libraries
come in contact. As a class of patrons
they are not only inoffensive but desirable.</p>

<p>While the yellow man is clearly not a
problem in libraries, it is equally certain
that the black man is a problem. This is
especially true in the South. In northern
libraries it is the rule to admit him without
distinction. Throughout the South,
with very few exceptions, the segregation
maintained in all social, educational and
religious institutions is enforced in libraries.</p>

<p>This paper will deal primarily with the
public library question. But account
should also be taken of the institutional
libraries to which negroes have access.</p>


<h3>Institutional Libraries</h3>

<p>The report of the U. S. Commissioner of
Education for 1910 contains a list of 189
secondary and higher schools for the colored
race in 16 states and the District of
Columbia. Of these 160 report libraries aggregating
368,684 volumes with an estimated
value of $295,788. Following is a
summary of the institutions and their libraries
arranged by states. Of these libraries
84 have less than 1,000 volumes; 56
have 1,000 to 5,000 volumes; 11 have between
5,000 and 10,000 volumes; 6 have between
10,000 and 20,000. Two have 26,607
and 27,000 respectively.</p>

<p>Many of these collections except in the
larger institutions, have been characterized
as "so unsuitable as to be almost worthless ... the
discarded refuse of garrets
and overcrowded store rooms, which
should have gone to the paper mill, but was
sent to these poor children through mistaken
kindness."</p>

<p>These libraries are primarily for the use
of the students, but they are usually open
to the townspeople for reading and reference.
While the people thus have access
to a collection of books for consultation,
it can not be said that they have the equivalent
of a public library, even where the
selection is good. It is a common occurrence,
however, throughout the country for
institutional libraries to operate against
the establishment of a public library without
acting as a satisfactory substitute.</p>


<h3>General Attitude</h3>

<p>The prevailing attitude toward libraries
for negroes is one of indifference among
the masses of both races. But the same
conditions existed for many years and still
exist in other parts of the country. The
library must follow the school, it can not
precede it. When it is remembered that
the educational awakening of the South is
of comparatively recent date and that anything
like general education of the negro
is still more recent, the small number of
public libraries for negroes will not appear
so strange. In a few places a vigorous demand
has arisen. In a few places the authorities
have not only supplied the demand
but have endeavored to stimulate
and enlarge it.</p>

<p>It may be said, however, that there are
still people who think that the negro is
incapable of education and that it actually
unfits him for usefulness. Uncle Remus
has a saying, "When you put a book into
a negro's hand you spoil a good plow
hand." This notion still lurks in the
minds of a surprisingly large number of
people, who cite the wretched condition
and dense ignorance of millions of negroes
after fifty years of freedom. In 1910 thirty
per cent of them were still illiterate. Libraries
can not flourish in illiteracy as
trees can not grow in a desert.</p>

<p>There are, however, oases in the desert,
bright and shining examples of individuals,
schools and whole communities, which
have demonstrated the negro's capacity for
the highest education and development.
There is a growing disposition to afford
him full opportunity for making the most
of himself.</p>

<p>While some librarians are urging action,
others shrink from it as from a disagreeable
task. One is endeavoring to look at
the subject of a negro library from the missionary
standpoint and is trying to convince
the trustees that such an innovation
would be desirable, but finds it very hard
to arouse any interest and enthusiasm. Another
proposes to let the question alone till
forced to take action. Another reports
that the city is on the verge of the question.
Another is having difficulty to find a
central location for a colored library where
white people do not object. One city with
a branch library in a negro high school
considers it an easy way out of a difficult
situation. The authorities realize that the
time is coming when these facilities will no
longer be adequate. At present their
funds are needed so much in other directions
that they hope to be able to postpone
this added expense for some time to come.
One library having a special room for
negroes never pushes this part of its work,
but does only what it is compelled to do by
city ordinance. Another where there is no
race distinction tells how the library is
overrun at times with negroes and what a
drawback this is to the work.</p>

<p>Some lend books to negroes but do not
allow them to sit in the reading room. This
practice is not established by rule and
regulation but rests on the disposition of
the librarians to be helpful to all. Public
sentiment will tolerate it in this form while
it would rebel at an attempt to guarantee
the same service in formal rules.</p>

<h3>Cities Having Colored Libraries</h3>

<p>Charlotte, N. C., is the first and only city
to build a library for negroes with its own
funds. After erecting a $25,000 Carnegie
building it spent $5,000 on a site and a separate
building for negroes which was
opened in 1906. But its only income for
maintenance is $400 a year from the city.
Most of the books have been donated. In
1911 the librarian of the white library
enlisted the interest of a Pittsburgh
woman who collected about 600 volumes
for it in the North. The librarian at Wilkes-Barr&eacute;,
Pa., sends it the best of her discarded
books. From these facts one may
infer what kind of standard is maintained.</p>

<p>The white library was incorporated by
the legislature in a special act, which at
the same time created a separate negro
board. Several ineffectual efforts have
been made to have the act changed to
place the colored library under control of
the white board and the supervision of the
white librarian. This would undoubtedly
result in greater efficiency, as now everybody
including the colored board seems to
be inactive and indifferent toward it. Its
failure however can hardly be ascribed to
the negro board alone because it is manifestly
impossible with such resources
under such conditions to conduct a library
which would command the respect and the
interest of either race.</p>

<p>Savannah, Ga., also has a small library
for negroes. It was organized in 1907
and is housed in rented quarters, but very
few persons seem to know of its existence.
The city appropriates $360 a year for it.
In 1911 it had 2,611 volumes and 1,244
were drawn for home use. Its total receipts
were $375.77. At the end of the year $35
was due the librarian for salary and there
was a deficit of $33.93. In 1910 Mr. Carnegie
offered $12,000 for a colored branch
building and the city has promised an
increased appropriation on the completion
of the building. For a time the negroes
tried to raise the money for a site by subscription,
but so far they have not succeeded.</p>

<p>Jacksonville, Fla., has in its Carnegie
building a separate room and books in
charge of a colored attendant. Of its
81,000 population half are colored, but the
negro registration is only five per cent and
the circulation six per cent of the whole.
No effort is being made to extend it. The
opinion prevails that the arrangement is
a mistake and that a branch library in the
negro quarter would bring out a much
larger use.</p>

<p>Galveston, Texas, has had a branch of
the Rosenberg library in the colored high
school since 1904. It contains 2,745
volumes. With a colored population less
than one-fifth as large as Jacksonville it
has twice as many borrowers but circulates
only one-fourth as many books, 2,433 last
year. This seems a very small number and
does not bear out the theory that a separate
branch enlarges its use.</p>

<p>In Memphis, Tenn., the Cossitt library
in 1903 entered into an agreement with
the LeMoyne Institute, a colored normal
school, which furnishes the room, and the
Cossitt library furnishes the librarian and
the books, which number about four thousand
added to a like number belonging to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the school. While these are used mainly
by pupils and teachers of the school, it
serves as the book supply for all interested
negroes in the city and surrounding district.</p>

<p>The facilities thus furnished seem to
meet the present demands pretty fully.
Much depends on the librarian's attitude,
which is helpful and encouraging. The circulation
last year was 13,947 vols. The
institute is erecting a new school building,
which will provide better library accommodations.</p>

<p>Louisville, Ky., was the first to establish
a full-fledged branch on a broad basis and
to erect a separate branch library building
for negroes. The original plan for ten
Carnegie branch libraries, of which seven
have been built, included two for negroes.
The first of these was opened in rented
quarters the same year as the main library
in 1905. Three years later it was moved
into the new $30,000 building.</p>

<p>In its administration the colored branch
is a part of the general library system and
is under the supervision of the main
library. The branch librarian, who is a
graduate of Hampton Institute, and the two
assistants are colored.</p>

<p>The branch serves as the reference
library for the colored high schools and
other educational institutions. It is in
close co-operation with the grade schools
through the collections of books which it
sends to the classrooms to be drawn by
the pupils for home use.</p>

<p>It has an assembly room which is used
for lectures, entertainments and numerous
other public meetings, and two classrooms
for smaller gatherings. There is a story
hour for children and several reading and
debating clubs for boys and girls and
adults. Through its various activities the
library not only circulates books and furnishes
facts but it is an educational and
social center from which radiate many influences
for general betterment.</p>

<p>Fine work is being done with children,
who draw 68 per cent of the books circulated.
An interesting account of it is
given in the Library Journal for April, 1910,
25:160-61, by Mrs. Rachel D. Harris, a
former teacher in the colored schools, who
is in charge of this department.</p>

<p>When the branch was started eight years
ago it was somewhat of an experiment and
there was doubt and apprehensiveness all
around with regard to the outcome of the
undertaking. But it has been a pronounced
success from the beginning. It has grown
steadily until last year 73,462 vols. were
drawn from it for home use. It has become
so popular that the second branch
is now under construction in the eastern
colored section of the city.</p>

<p>The colored people are proud of this
library and its achievements. Its opening
marked an epoch in the development of
the race which is second in importance
only to the opening of the first colored free
schools there in 1870.</p>

<p>Houston, Texas, also has a separate
branch building opened last April. For the
past four years it was maintained in a
small way in the colored high school. The
new building is distinctively a product of
negro enterprise. Booker T. Washington's
secretary called on Andrew Carnegie personally
and secured the promise of $15,000
on condition that the city of Houston
would agree to provide not less than $1,500
annually for its maintenance. The $1,500
for the site was raised by colored citizens
entirely among their own people. The
plans for the building were drawn by a
colored architect and its erection supervised
by a committee of a separate board
of trustees, which consisted of nine colored
men. The librarian is a colored girl
who is responsible only to the colored
trustees. Although she and the trustees
consult freely with the librarian and trustees
of the public library, the latter act
only in an advisory capacity to them. They
are therefore justly proud of the library
as their own achievement. It contains
5,000 volumes. From a colored population
of 30,000 the registered borrowers were
only 1,261 last year and the books drawn
5,117. These numbers seem very small,
but no doubt there will be a large increase
in the new building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>While the Houston method of management
may contribute to the negro's self-respect
and minister somewhat to the
pride and independence of a few of their
number, the wisdom of the plan may well
be questioned. The results are bound to
be inferior unless experience counts for
nothing. It is unfortunate that so many
cities in their first venture proceed with
such disregard of the experience of other
places. But the limit is reached when the
same city repeats the process with a
second board after one board has learned
its lesson. This applies not only to the
details of planning, erecting and furnishing
a building but equally if not more to its
operation, the selection, purchase and cataloging
of books, the appointment of assistants
and the transacting of its daily business.</p>

<p>The white public library boards of Nashville
and New Orleans both have plans
under way for the erection of Carnegie
colored branch buildings, each to cost
$25,000. In Nashville the negroes are
raising $1,000 and the city is paying $5,000
toward the site. In New Orleans the city
will purchase the site. In neither of these
places is there any public provision at
present for supplying books to negroes.</p>

<p>In Atlanta, Ga., the leading educational
center of the South for negroes, they are
still without public library facilities,
although agitation on the subject began
over ten years ago. On the day of the
opening of the beautiful $125,000 Carnegie
building a committee of colored men called
on the library board. Prof. W. E. B. DuBois
of Atlanta University acting as
spokesman said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, we are a committee come
to ask you to do justice to the black people
of Atlanta by giving them the same
free library privileges that you propose
giving to whites. Every argument which
can be adduced to show the need of libraries
for whites applies with redoubled
force to the negroes. More than any other
part of our population they need instruction,
inspiration and proper diversion; they
need to be lured from temptation of the
streets and saved from evil influences, and
they need a growing acquaintance with
what the best of the world's souls have
thought and done and said. It seems
hardly necessary in the twentieth century
to argue before men like you the necessity
and propriety of placing the best means
of human uplifting into the hands of the
poorest and lowest and blackest.</p>

<p>"The spirit of this great gift to the city
has not the spirit of caste or exclusion but
rather the catholic spirit which recognizes
no artificial differences of rank or birth or
race, but seeks to give all men equal opportunity
to make the most of themselves. It
is our sincere hope that this city will prove
itself broad enough and just enough to
administer this trust in the true spirit in
which it was given."</p>

<p>The chairman asked, "Do you not think
that allowing whites and negroes to use
this library would be fatal to its usefulness?"
Another member of the committee
replied that they did not ask to use this
library nor even ask equal privileges but
only some privileges somewhere.</p>

<p>The chairman then made these points
clear: (1) That negroes would not be
permitted to use the Carnegie Library in
Atlanta; (2) That some library facilities
would be provided for them in the future;
(3) That the city council would be asked
to appropriate a sum proportionate to the
amount of taxes paid by negroes of the
city; (4) That efforts would be made to
induce northern philanthropists to aid such
a library.</p>

<p>Later Mr. Carnegie offered to give the
money necessary for the erection of a
branch library for negroes. When the
details of its administration came up for
consideration the negroes demanded representation
on the library board. This was
positively refused and the proceedings
were so completely blocked that the
negroes of Atlanta are still without any
public library advantages.</p>


<h3>Methods of Management</h3>

<p>From the cases cited it appears that
there are four distinct methods of dealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
with this question in the South: (1) To
admit the negro to the same building on
equal terms with others as is done in
Baltimore, Wilmington, Washington and
some of the Missouri libraries. This
method is not satisfactory to the whites.
As one report says, "There are white people
who are deterred from using the library
because in so doing they must touch
elbows with colored folks.... We
could do better service to both races if
there could be a separation, for we must
take the people with their prejudices,
especially in the use of the library, which
is a purely voluntary matter." (2) To
admit him to the same building but to a
separate room, which is not satisfactory to
the negro. One library which has this plan
reports, "Many of the educated and cultured
negroes (for there are some even in
the South) will not come unless they can
do so on the same social equality and use
the same apartments as the white
patrons." (3) To have a separate library
under control of members of their own
race. This is almost certain to produce
inferior results on account of their inexperience
and lack of knowledge regarding
every phase of the work. (4) To have a
separate branch in charge of colored assistants
who are under the direction and supervision
of one board and one librarian,
who have control over the entire library
including all branches and other agencies.
This plan assures the greatest economy
and efficiency and will probably be adopted
by all the libraries whose funds will permit
it. A separate colored board is as unnecessary
and unbusinesslike as would be a
separate board for each white branch.</p>

<p>On the advantages of a separate branch
library one colored man writes: "In the
South the separation is not only necessary
for the peace and cordial relations desirable
to be maintained but the colored
branches are desirable because the colored
people would use them so a hundred times
more than they would otherwise. The feeling
of perfect welcome, ownership and unqualified
privilege are all necessary to
patrons who are to get the best possible
from libraries among them. These things
in the South can only be had in separate
branches as much as it is regrettable that
there should be a mind and spirit demanding
separate libraries."</p>


<h3>Traveling Libraries</h3>

<p>Delaware and Kentucky are the only
state library commissions reporting special
traveling libraries for negroes. Last
year "seven traveling libraries of 30 to 50
volumes each were arranged for the use
of the colored schools in Delaware, and
the entire charge and care of these libraries
was given over to the State College for
Colored Students near Dover." The Kentucky
commission has two libraries of 50
volumes each in circulation and is planning
to send more. Hampton Institute also
sends out traveling collections of books.</p>

<p>Another system of traveling libraries is
that established in 1910 by James H.
Gregory of Marblehead, Mass., for distribution
through Atlanta University
among the negroes of the South. There
are about 60 libraries of 48 volumes each.
They are sent to any community, school,
church or other organization for one year
and then exchanged for a different set.
Two interesting articles on these libraries
and their founder were published by G.
S. Dickerman in the Southern Workman,
August and September, 1910.</p>


<h3>What the Negro Reads</h3>

<p>What the negro reads is in itself a large
and interesting subject. A brief article
on it dealing equally with what the negro
does not read, appeared in the Critic, July
1906, from Mr. George B. Utley, then
librarian of the Jacksonville public library.
The first book drawn from the Louisville
library was Washington's "Up from slavery."
The most striking feature of the
circulation in general is the comparatively
small percentage of fiction read. Of the
258,438 volumes drawn from the Louisville
library during its first six years only
46 per cent was fiction.</p>

<p>This may be due to the fact that the
so-called leisure class, who are supposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
read most of the fiction, is smaller among
the colored people; or that the novel does
not appeal so strongly to the negro mind;
or that the library is used more largely
by pupils, teachers, ministers and other
professional people, who come to it for
more serious purposes.</p>

<p>A book entitled "Tuskegee and its people,"
edited by Booker T. Washington, contains
biographical sketches of many
negroes who have gone out from that
school to work for the elevation of their
race. These sketches give a remarkable
picture of the "conditions that environ the
masses of the negro people," as well as
their struggles for improvement.</p>

<p>One of them describing the country
school which he attended writes, "When
I reached the point where the teacher
ordered me to get a United States history,
the book store did not have one, but sold
me a biography of Martin Luther instead,
which I studied for some time thinking
that I was learning something about the
U. S."</p>

<p>Years later "I betook me to the woods,
where I read everything I could get. It
was during this time that accidentally, I
may say providentially, I got hold of a
book containing the life of Ignacius Sancho;
and I have never read anything that
has given me more inspiration. I wish
every negro boy in the land might read
it."</p>

<p>Another Tuskegee graduate, a woman
whose mother as a slave had been taught
to read by her master's daughter, writes:
"Sundays, with my sisters gathered about
her knees, we would sit for hours listening
as mother would read church hymns for
us."</p>

<p>The articles by Mr. Dickerman above
referred to give the results of some investigations
on their choice of books. He
received answers from 35 leading negro
schools in response to a request for a list
of such "books as had been found in the
experience of their schools to be the most
popular and the best and which they would
recommend." The "Life of Lincoln" appeared
on 15 of these lists; "Little women" 15;
"Robinson Crusoe" 14; "Paul Dunbar" 11;
"Uncle Tom's cabin" 10; "Ivanhoe" 9;
"Souls of black folk" 9; "Ramona" 8; "Life
of Douglass" 8; "Uncle Remus" 7. Six
lists included "Alice in wonderland,"
Grimm's "Fairy tales," "John Halifax,"
"Last days of Pompeii," and "Swiss family
Robinson."</p>

<p>These lists all came from schools and
therefore bear the earmarks of the schoolmaster.
But the largest part of the reading
by negroes is done by the pupils and
teachers in connection with their school
work. This would account for the preponderance
of the literature and history
classes. Miss Sarah B. Askew observes
that among the general readers in a public
library "the colored people's tastes are
for quick action, strong emotion, vivid
coloring, and simplicity of narration."
Books by and about their own people are
in constant demand. The colored magazines,
those devoted especially to their
interests and those published by colored
men are always popular.</p>

<p>There is also a growing demand for
books useful to the mechanic in his daily
work. Chauffeurs "avail themselves of
technical books on automobiles." An early
experience in the Louisville library was
with a woman who made a business of
raising chickens. She called at the library
for medical help because many of them
were dying. Strangely enough this subject
had been overlooked in selecting the
books and the librarian was unable to prescribe
for sick chickens. But a book on
poultry was ordered for her immediately.</p>


<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Following are some conclusions regarding
libraries for negroes:</p>

<p>(1) That books and reading are of the
utmost value in the education, development
and progress of the race.</p>

<p>(2) That in northern public libraries
they are admitted to all privileges without
distinction.</p>

<p>(3) That in southern libraries the
segregation of the races prevails, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
does, in all educational, religious and other
social institutions.</p>

<p>(4) That in many places institutional
libraries are supplying the book wants of
the few negroes who really have need of
libraries.</p>

<p>(5) That among the masses of the colored
race there is as yet very little demand
for libraries.</p>

<p>(6) That where a genuine demand has
manifested itself and up-to-date facilities
have been provided negroes have been
quick to use them and have made commendable
progress.</p>

<p>(7) That in some of the large cities
containing a great many negroes who are
intelligent and who pay taxes the provision
made for them is sadly inadequate
or is entirely lacking.</p>

<p>(8) That southern librarians generally
are kindly and helpfully disposed toward
them and that the majority of the white
people favor a fair deal for them, including
the best training and the fullest enlightenment.</p>

<p>(9) That in the South any arrangement
which aims to serve the two races in the
same room or in the same building is detrimental
to the greatest good of both. Complete
segregation is essential to the best
work for all.</p>

<p>(10) That many libraries are not financially
able to conduct separate departments
and so the negro loses out.</p>

<p>(11) That a few cities have splendid
facilities for them, a few others are now
establishing branches, a considerable number
are discussing the question seriously
and another considerable number which
should be at work are doing nothing.</p>

<p>(12) That the best solution of the problem
is the separate branch in charge of
colored assistants under the supervision
and control of the white authorities.</p>

<p>(13) That even in northern cities which
have large segregated colored districts
such separate branches would result in
reaching a larger number of negroes and
doing better work for both races.</p>

<p>(14) That the South is entitled to the
sympathy and help of the North on this
question, which is only a part of the larger
question of negro education. That sympathy
will come with fuller information
and will increase as the size and seriousness
of the problem is more fully understood.</p>

<h2>THIRD GENERAL SESSION<br />


(Wednesday morning, June 25, 1913)</h2>

<p>The PRESIDENT: There is a matter of
business to come up this morning. At the
last conference the Association adopted an
amendment to the Constitution which, to
become effective, must be ratified at this
meeting. It may be added that the requisite
notice required by the Constitution, of
thirty days, has been given by the Secretary,
through publication in the Bulletin,
where you have doubtless seen the proposed
amendment together with the by-law
which is dependent, of course, upon
the adoption of the amendment itself. The
Secretary will please read the proposed
amendment as adopted at the Ottawa conference.</p>

<p>The SECRETARY: I will also read that
portion of Section 14 of the Constitution
to which the amendment would apply:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<b>Council.</b> Membership. The Council
shall consist of the executive board, all
ex-presidents of the Association who continue
as members thereof, all presidents
of affiliated societies who are members of
the Association, twenty-five members elected
by the Association at large, and twenty-five
elected by the Council itself,"&mdash;</p></div>

<p>And the proposed amendment consists of
the following words to be inserted at that
place:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&mdash;"and one member from each state, provincial
and territorial library association
or any association covering two or more
such geographical divisions which complies
with the conditions for such representation
set forth in the by-laws."</p></div>

<p>The PRESIDENT: The amendment is
before you for consideration. What is your
pleasure? Are you ready for the question?</p>

<p>(The question being called for and put,
the amendment was adopted.)</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: Dependent upon the
adoption of the amendment to the Consti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>tution
there is now before you for consideration
a proposed amendment to the by-laws.
The Secretary will please read the
suggested amendment which carries into
effect now the Constitutional amendment
which you have just adopted and which
becomes effective, in that it has now been
adopted by two successive conferences.</p>

<p>The Secretary then read the proposed
amendment Section 3a, which is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Sec. 3a. Each state, territorial and provincial
library association (or any association
covering two or more such geographical
divisions) having a membership
of not less than fifteen members, may be
represented in the Council by the president
of such association, or by an alternate
elected at the annual meeting of the association.
The annual dues shall be $5.00
for each association having a membership
of fifty or less, and ten cents per additional
capita where membership is above that
number. The privileges and advantages
of the A. L. A. conferences shall be available
only to those holding personal membership
or representing institutional membership
in the Association."</p></div>

<p>The President then put the question and
the above amendment to the by-laws was
duly adopted.</p>

<p>Dr. ANDREWS: I move the addition of
the words "or to members of other affiliated
societies," in order not to bar these
members from attendance at our meetings.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: Dr. Andrews' amendment
is to include the words "or to members
of other affiliated societies."</p>

<p>Mr. RANCK: I think, as a member of
the Committee that had something to do
with the drafting of the proposed by-law,
that I can say that the purpose of that
provision was that there should be some
advantage to persons holding membership
in these organizations, to get the railroad
rates, hotel rates, etc.; in other words, to
have some pecuniary advantage in their
becoming members and not to be able to
come and get those advantages without
holding any kind of a membership.</p>

<p>If I may be permitted, Mr. President, I
should like to give a few figures with reference
to the distribution of the members
of the Council as it now exists, as given
in the last handbook. There were 72 members
of the Council, counting the one or
two who have died, representing 48 states,
the District of Columbia and Canada. However,
in the Council only 20 States in the
Union have representation. In other words,
there are 28 states in the Union that are
not represented in the Council. The population
of these 28 states is nearly thirty-three
millions and their area is nearly
two million square miles, whereas the area
of the states that are represented is a little
over a million square miles. The point
is, Mr. President, the purpose of the
amendment to the Constitution and these
amendments is to give a wider geographical
distribution of representation in the
Council; in other words, that more than
half of the area of the United States may
be brought in, on account of this geographical
representation, and that the thirty-three
millions of people who live in those
states may be able to get a representation
which it seems at the present time they do
not have.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: The question before
the conference is on the proposed amendment
of the by-law as offered by Dr. Andrews.</p>

<p>(The President put the question and the
amendment was duly adopted.)</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: The question now is
upon the amendment to the by-laws as
amended.</p>

<p>(The President put the question and the
amendment to the by-laws was duly adopted.)</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: The Association during
the past year suffered grievous loss
in the passing of two of its notable members,
members who had long been identified
with the Association and its work,
and I may add the loss of a friend of librarians
everywhere, that splendid gentleman,
Mr. Francis Fisher Browne, of The
Dial,&mdash;a man gentle of soul, keen of intellect
and fine of fiber. While perhaps we
are not called upon to take official notice
of his passing it seems to me very well
that we should group him with those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
whose loss we mourn at this time. By request
of the Executive Board and of the
Council a committee consisting of Dr. Putnam,
Mr. Bowker and Mr. Wellman have
been asked to draft memorial resolutions
on the passing of Dr. Billings and Mr.
Soule and I would ask Dr. Putnam to report
at this time.</p>

<p>Dr. PUTNAM: With your permission I
will ask Mr. Wellman to read the suggested
minute with reference to Mr. Soule.
And the Committee would suggest that if
the expression in these minutes appears to
you just, that they be adopted by a rising
vote.</p>

<p>Mr. Wellman then read the following
resolution which was unanimously adopted
by a rising vote.</p>


<h3>CHARLES CARROLL SOULE</h3>

<p>With profound sorrow, we record the
death of Charles C. Soule, whose services
and relation to the American Library Association
were in many ways unique.
Though himself not a librarian, yet in the
early days of the public library he was
one of those who foresaw the great force
which it might be made to exert in our
democratic civilization; and to promote
the wise realization of this vision, he labored
unceasingly as a member of this Association
for more than thirty years and
was a constant attendant at the meetings.
He served as vice-president in 1890, as
member of the Institute for six years, as
member of the Council for eight years, as
trustee of the endowment fund for twelve
years, and as a member of the Publishing
Board for eighteen years. But his distinctive
contribution was in efforts towards
the improvement of library architecture;
and here by his study and writings, as
well as by creating the office of advisory
expert in building, he did more than any
other man to further the planning of library
buildings for library work.</p>

<p>In reciting the tale of his accomplishment,
it is impossible to forget the man.
Unselfish and high-minded, a good counsellor
and a consistent friend, he ever showed
eager and affectionate interest in the work
of his fellow members, and especially in
the success of those beginning their careers.
Above all, he possessed a generous
faith in his associates and an unfailing
good will. These were but a few of the
qualities which enabled him to achieve so
much for the public library, and which endeared
him to hosts of librarians throughout
the land.</p>

<p>Dr. PUTNAM: Mr. President, this is proposed
as a minute for the records of the
Association. It is therefore headed "John
Shaw Billings."</p>

<p>The resolution was unanimously adopted
by a rising vote.</p>


<h3>JOHN SHAW BILLINGS</h3>

<p class="ph3">April 12, 1838&mdash;March 18, 1913</p>

<p class="ph3">A member of the American Library Association
1881-1913&mdash;Its President, 1901-02</p>

<p>It is seldom that the death of an individual
removes from two professions a
unit of singular power in each. But such
was the loss in the recent death of John
Shaw Billings; a scientist in a department
of science intensive and exacting, a librarian
rigorously scientific in a profession
broadly humane. To the former he made
original contributions which constituted
him an authority within special fields; but
also in his great Index-Catalog of Medical
Literature, one which assured certainty
and promoted advance in every field&mdash;and
left the entire medical profession his
debtor. As a librarian, having first
brought to preeminence the professional
library entrusted to him, he was called to
the organization into a single system of
isolated funds and institutions, achieved
that organization, and lived to see it, under
his charge develop into the largest general
library system in the world, with a
possible influence upon our greatest metropolis
of incalculable importance to it,
and through it, to the welfare of our entire
country.</p>

<p>The qualities which enabled him to accomplish
all this included not merely certain
native abilities&mdash;among them, penetration,
concentration, vigor, tenacity of purpose
and directness of method, but others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
developed by self-denial, self-discipline,
and a complete dedication to the work in
hand. It was through these that he earned
his education and his scientific training;
and they hardened into habits which attended
him to the end of his days, when he
concluded in toil that shirked no detail a
life begun in toil and devoted to detail.</p>

<p>Such habits, a keen faculty of analysis,
and a scientific training kept him aloof
alike from hasty generalizations and from
the impulses of mere emotion; while his
military training induced in him three
characteristics which marked alike his
treatment of measures and his dealings
with men; incisiveness, a distaste for the
superfluous and the redundant, and an insistence
upon the suitable subordination of
the part to the whole. In this combination,
and in the knowledge of, and power over,
men which accompanied it, he was unique
among librarians; in his complete lack of
ostentation he was unusual among men.
His mind was ever on the substance, indifferent
to the form. A <b>power</b> in two professions,
to have termed him the "ornament"
of either would have affronted him;
for he was consistently impatient of the
merely ornamental. Any <b>personal</b> ostentation
was actually repugnant to him; and he
avoided it as completely in what he suffered
as in what he achieved; bearing,
with a reticence that asked no allowances,
physical anguish in which most men would
have found ample excuse from every care.</p>

<p>If such a combination of traits assured
his remarkable efficiency, it might not have
seemed calculated to promote warm personal
or social attachments. Yet there was
in him also a singular capacity for friendship;
not indeed for impulsive and indiscriminate
intimacies, but for those selective,
deep, steady and lasting friendships which
are proof of the fundamental natures of
men. And however terse, austere, and
even abrupt, his manner in casual relations,
where a really human interest was at
stake he might be relied upon for sympathies
both warm and considerate, and the
more effective because consistently just
and inevitably sincere.</p>

<p>The testimonies to these qualities in his
character, to these powers, and to his varied
achievements, have already been many
and impressive. The American Library
Association wishes to add its own, with
a special recognition not merely of the
value to the community of the things
which he accomplished, but of the value to
individuals in the example of a character
and abilities so resolutely developed and
so resolutely applied to the service of science
and the service of men.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: To offer a telegram
as a substitute for a long and pleasurably
anticipated paper is cause for regret, but
such must be the case this morning as
Miss Arnold finds it impossible to be with
us. The telegram reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Emergency meeting of Simmons College
Corporation has been appointed for
Wednesday and prevents me from attending
library meeting. Extreme regrets.</p>

<p>
SARAH LOUISE ARNOLD."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The general theme of this morning's
session is "Library influence in the home,
in the shop, on the farm, and among defectives
and dependents." We shall begin
the morning's program with a paper on
"The working library for the artisan and
the craftsman," by EDWARD F. STEVENS,
librarian Pratt Institute free library,
and director of the school of library science,
Brooklyn.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>THE WORKING LIBRARY FOR THE
ARTISAN AND THE CRAFTSMAN</h2>


<p>It is not my privilege to speak to you
at this time of the professional, technical,
or practical aspects of that recent phase
of library work wherein is attempted the
reconciliation of shopmen with bookmen.
In the very few moments placed at my
disposal I may mention only that human
relationship which enters so largely into a
librarian's dealings with men who are concerned
with and about their work.</p>

<p>The straightforward, sympathetic intercourse
of man with man may adorn to
the point of making almost beautiful a department
of librarianship which is extremely
matter-of-fact in its essential char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>acter
and might easily become commonplace
in its practicality. The business of a
technology department in a public library
may best be expressed in terms of the
statement of the policy of the Franklin
Union established in recent years in Philadelphia&mdash;"the
further education of men already
employed." Such a working library
is strictly a library of work. It is almost
oppressively utilitarian. Yet to a librarian
who has had the privilege of making books
known to artisans and craftsmen, and who
is now denied that privilege, the sense of
the loss of the fellowships, not to say
friendships, that formerly were a part of
his daily occupation proves that the sympathetic
was after all the potential element
in his experience.</p>

<p>I may say with Lowell, "I like folks who
like an honest piece of steel.... There
is always more than the average human
nature in a man who has a hearty sympathy
with iron."</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt has given us a maxim
that deserves to be written as a rule
of life&mdash;"That which one does which all
can do but won't do is the greatest of
greatness."</p>

<p>Therein is the greatness of work with
practical men&mdash;the discernment of the
simplest facts of life, the performance of
the simplest acts of life in working out the
complex things of life, recognizing, to begin
with, that a man's difficulty is at once
less a difficulty when it becomes the
friendly concern of a fellow-man. My own
first experience as a seeker after help in
a public library in matters technical that
were then of great importance to me, met
the rebuff and disappointment that have
given me a point of view which amounts to
a conviction.</p>

<p>In the present day, the library assumes
considerable confidence in inviting the
workingman into its constituency, and the
workingman must come to it with no less
confidence if the library expects its justification.
The mechanic, as formerly the
scholar, must approach the library with a
calculated expectation. The librarian
must understand him, believe in him, and
in turn make himself understood by him.</p>

<p>In a recent issue of the <b>American Machinist</b>,
a writer deplores the general lack
of sympathy and interest in the affairs of
the "unheralded mechanic." That the life
he lives has no place in men's thoughts
nor in literature. This is the closing statement:
"As it is, if left to themselves, mechanics
will by their silence continue to
let those outside the shop think of them as
nothing but men tied to a whistle."</p>

<p>Leigh Hunt (himself very much an outsider)
in a familiar essay makes this
friendly observation: "A business of
screws and iron wheels is, or appears to
be, a very commonplace matter; but not
so the will of the hand that sets them in
motion; not so the operations of the mind
that directs them what to utter."</p>

<p>But this mechanic that now nears the
public library is coming neither as a pathetic
figure in distress, nor as a mysterious
or heroic figure beyond our comprehension.
He comes as an unpretending
man dignified by earnestness of purpose
not to discredit an honorable vocation.</p>

<p>The best of mutual understanding and
feeling, however, will not secure the chief
ends of librarianship except so far as they
splendidly prepare the way. The recognition
of books as tools comes only as the
books stand the same practical test that
the workman applies to his instruments.</p>

<p>The librarian must furnish books shaped
to the man's hand, books that he can use
to perform work, that he can depend upon
as true, accurate, precise, simple, efficient,
economical, reliable in the same sense that
his tools must be all these. And so, the
selection of books for a working library
of technology becomes not unlike the testing
of instruments of precision. Care in
selection is of supreme importance in fitting
up a tool-shop of books.</p>

<p>Wisdom in application is scarcely second
to intelligence in choice. A practical
man does not often come to a library for
this or that particular book, for the work
of a specified author, or for a title that he
has in mind. If he does, he cannot always
be depended upon to know his own wishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
in the matter. What this man wants is
information about a topic that concerns
him. He leaves it to the library to tell him
in what printed form that information can
be had&mdash;and it's risky, for the library, to
trifle with him or to play him false. Hesitation,
indecision, irresolution are fatal. If
the library exhibits lack of faith in itself,
who, indeed, shall have faith in it? The
workingman will be sure to entertain the
same contempt for the librarian's doubtful
application of even the best books as he
himself would of the misuse of good tools
in his own trade.</p>

<p>This necessity for books that will answer
to needs is the incentive in the erection
of a working library to which men
may resort.</p>

<p>At home we have a permanent and constantly
revised selection of the most useful
technical books registered on cards of
varying colors showing the differing characteristics
of the books included. This is
our Works Library. And within it, on
blue cards, are listed the simplest and
most direct texts for the man with the
least preparation for books. This is our
Dinner-Pail Library. And starting with
these, we may go on with a degree of confidence
in teaching men the use of tools
the handling of which we ourselves understand.</p>

<p>Preparedness in attitude, preparedness
in equipment, await the arrival of the
man the most skeptical of the library's
guests. Does he come and go away again
confirmed in his skepticism? If he does,
it's the library's fault, not his. Does he
come, and remain, to come again? Then
he is ready to pay the tribute of his allegiance
that becomes the librarian's great
reward.</p>

<p>We have heard the <b>American Machinist</b>
complain that the mechanic found no voice
to sing his praises. Not less is the genus
librarian unwept, unhonored, and unsung.
He expects praise as little as he desires
it, and, perhaps, I may say, deserves it.
But the ready word of appreciation, the
acknowledgment of the library's help in
overcoming difficulties that drove a man
there as a last resort, the confession of
awakening to the new knowledge of the
library's wider purpose and power, is expressed
often with a frankness and fervor
that surprise and gratify the fortunate
librarian who has been instrumental in
bringing things to pass.</p>

<p>I recall how men of few words and little
sentiment have spontaneously related
to me their experiences of misfortune, perplexity,
disappointment, or other embarrassment
that caused them to turn to the
public library for a possible helping hand,
and then, how the library did not fail them
in their extremity. At such times, I knew
that the free library was doing what it undertook
to do.</p>

<p>Of this sort are the few, the impressive
instances that illustrate how, on occasions,
a working library can meet very exceptional
requirements. There are also the
very many&mdash;the students, apprentices,
shopmen, machinists, inventors, chemists,
engineers, manufacturers&mdash;all artisans and
craftsmen in their various ways, who are
coming to learn that in their usual daily
processes they may expect from the public
library the ordinary, indispensable service
that the library has always performed
for those who know the value of books.</p>

<p>It is this complete idea of a library that
still fails of development in the minds
of these men, an idea that the library is a
live thing, a public utility of which they
will naturally and inevitably avail themselves
as they do of the street-cars to
take them both to and away from their
work. Nothing is needed to convince men
that a utility <b>is</b> a utility save the satisfying
use of it. When they have found that the
library speeds them on in the direction of
the day's occupation, then it becomes easy
enough for them to learn that the library
can also get them far removed from it.
And when the workingman fully comprehends
the <b>working</b> library, and by means
of it is introduced to the <b>diverting</b> library,
he becomes a man with the greatest capacity
for usefulness, and the library's
conquest of the community is finished and
triumphant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: Mr. Stevens has very
forcefully brought out the factor that a
book may be in bringing into life dormant
faculties that might otherwise go to
waste and recalls to us the remark of
Prof. Dewey, that the loss of the unearned
increment is as nothing compared with
the loss of the undiscovered resource.</p>

<p>Of course you know as well as the members
of the program committee that they
had nothing to do with the selection of the
next speaker; the topic chose her. How
could anyone else be asked to present the
subject of "The woman on the farm," than
Miss LUTIE E. STEARNS, of the Wisconsin
free library commission?</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>THE WOMAN ON THE FARM</h2>


<p>Modern programs of library extension
through public libraries as distinguished
from traveling library systems are practically
confined to an arbitrary line drawn
tightly around the city's limits. Charters,
laws, or ordinances under which many libraries
operate are usually interpreted to
restrict the use of such institutions to a
narrow area and no great attempt has been
made through legislation, save in California
and a few isolated examples elsewhere,
to extend library privileges to adjacent
communities. It is a happy omen for the
future that the president of the American
Library Association, the custodian of a library
catering to two-million city dwellers
with a circulation second in rank to
Greater New York, should have seen fit
on his own initiative to place among the
topics of this meeting the needs of the
woman on the farm, the real founder of
the city's citizenship.</p>

<p>"Who's the greatest woman in history?"
was the query debated by Kansas school
teachers recently. They considered Joan
of Arc, Queen Elizabeth, Semiramis, Cleopatra,
Cornelia, Catherine of Russia, Maria
Theresa, Grace Darling, Florence Nightingale,
Susan B. Anthony, and half a hundred
others. When they came to deciding,
all the names known to fame were ruled
out. And to whom do you suppose the
judges awarded the palm? Here is the answer:
"The wife of the farmer of moderate
means who does her own cooking,
washing, ironing and sewing, brings up a
family of boys and girls to be useful members
of society and finds time for intellectual
improvement."</p>

<p>These teachers knew that woman, they
knew the drudgery she faced at four or
five o'clock every morning the year 'round.
There are twenty millions of her in this
country of ours, she makes up nearly one-fourth
of the population of the country,
and while we are dealing with these most
"vital statistics," we may include the
tragic fact that sixty-six per cent of those
committed to insane hospitals are from
rural districts, the farm women constituting
the great majority thereof.</p>

<p>And yet the needs of this great, deserving
class of "humans" with minds and
hearts even more receptive to ideas than
are city women&mdash;the needs of such as
these are as yet almost wholly unrealized
by librarians aside from Commission workers.
No committee of the American Library
Association has ever had the joy of
working out a program of library extension
from the great city systems to rural readers.
The question put by the then President
Roosevelt to his Country Life Commission,
"How can the life of the farm
family be made less solitary, fuller of opportunity,
freer from drudgery, more comfortable,
happier, and more attractive?"
still awaits solution from the library standpoint.</p>

<p>Though agriculture is our oldest and by
far our largest and most important industry,
it has only recently occurred to us
in the United States that we had a rural
problem. It is only within the last decade
or so that we have awakened to the
fact that there is a rural as well as an urban
problem, and the library world is too
prone to keep from recognizing it. We
are not concerned in this connection with
the problem of the retired farmer who
moves into a town to spend his last days
which are, seemingly, all he is willing to
spend; nor shall we discuss those restless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
flat dwellers in our cities who, tempted
by such alluring and wholly immoral titles
as "The Fat of the Land," "The Earth
Bountiful," "A Self-Supporting Home,"
"Three Acres and a Cow," or "Three Acres
and Liberty"&mdash;"for those to whom the idea
of liberty is more inspiring than that of
the cow"&mdash;attempt to start ginseng, guinea
pig, pheasant, and peacock farms, and who
return to the city as shorn of guineas as
the pigs they leave behind them.</p>

<p>In the serious solution of this problem,
we may, in truth, differ as to the sort of
farmers we would benefit. As Sir Horace
Plunkett has said in his "Rural problem
in America," "The New York City idea
is probably that of a Long Island home
where one might see on Sunday, weather
permitting, the horny-handed son of weekday
toil in Wall Street, rustically attired,
inspecting his Jersey cows and aristocratic
fowls." These supply a select circle in New
York City with butter and eggs at a price
which leaves nothing to be desired unless
it be some information as to cost of production.
Full justice is done to the new
country life when the Farmers' Club of
New York fulfills its chief function&mdash;the
annual dinner at Delmonico's. Then Agriculture
is extolled in fine Virgilian style,
the Hudson villa and the Newport cottage
being permitted to divide the honors of the
rural revival with the Long Island home.
"But to my bucolic intelligence," concludes
Sir Horace, "it would seem that against
the back-to-the-land movement of Saturday
afternoon, the captious critic might set
the rural exodus of Monday morning."</p>

<p>To the New England librarian there
probably comes the picture of rugged, bean-clad
hills with "electrics" in every valley
eager to take the intellectual rustics to
the Lowell lectures or the Boston Symphony
Orchestra. That books are appreciated
in the rural districts even in a state
that boasts a library in every town is
shown by a letter from one who had received
the volumes sent out by the "Massachusetts
Society to Encourage Studies at
Home." "I do not know where I should
stop if I tried to tell how much these library
books have helped me in my isolated
life&mdash;I have craved so much and there
seemed no access possible to anything I
wanted. I have lived always with a longing
for something different; life was a burden
to be carried cheerfully, yet I never
quite conquered the feeling that the burden
was heavy. Books have taken away
that feeling and before I was aware, the
load was gone. I have written thus of
myself, not because my individual experience
is of importance enough to interest
anyone, but because I believe the world
is full of people with the same wants that
I have and it may be some satisfaction to
know how fully you are supplying them."</p>

<p>To the librarian of New Jersey, the isolated
dwellers of the salt marshes would
come to mind. Maryland suggests to
some librarian epicures the oyster farm,
with its succulent product, but to others
comes the vision of the "real thing" supplied
as in Washington County with the
ideal arrangement of central library,
branches, deposit stations, traveling libraries,
and automobile delivery to the very
doors of the Maryland farm homes&mdash;the
most ideal arrangement of rural extension
that exists in America today.</p>

<p>To the Georgian, the "cracker" presents
itself with its "Uneeda" book appeal. The
"mountain-white" of Kentucky, who comes
to Berea in his seventeenth year to learn
his letters, would surely appreciate an opportunity
to go on with them when he gets
"back home." In the north middle west,
where farms are still surrounded by a
fringe of pine and an "infinite destiny," a
farmer's wife writes as follows: "For
many years I have lived on a farm on the
cleared land of Northern Wisconsin, and I
have made an earnest study of the conditions
that surround the lives of the average
isolated farmer and his family. I have
seen all of the loneliness and desolation of
their lives, I have witnessed all the dreariness
and poverty of their homes. I have
been with them when our nearest railroad
station meant a twenty-eight mile trip
through bottomless mud or over shaking
corduroy; where our nearest post-office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
was eighteen miles away, over the same
impassable roads and where we were often
without mail for weeks at a time; when
the nearest public library was sixty miles
away; when the only element of culture or
progress we possessed was the little backwoods
school, housed in a tumble-down
log shack and presided over by careless
or incompetent teachers. I have watched
civilization come to us step by step,&mdash;the
railroad, the rural mail delivery, the country
telephone, and other modern rural conveniences.
But, before any of these, right
into the midst of our lonely backwoods
life, came the traveling library, for it is
characteristic of the traveling library that
it is not dependent on modern conveniences
for its appearance. I can recall
the thrill of joy with which we received
our first case of books. I read their titles
over and over, handled and caressed them
in a perfectly absurd manner. Almost all
of the books were old friends of mine; but,
to our little neighborhood of foreigners,
they were "brand new" and the enthusiasm
over that library knew no bounds.</p>

<p>"We had a regular literary revival that
winter. We talked books in season and
out of season; and from talking about the
books in the little library we fell to talking
of other books; of books we had read in
our younger, happier days. It mattered
little if in the course of these conversations
books and authors were hopelessly
mixed.</p>

<p>"I cannot say that we derived any great
amount of knowledge from our first library,
but I do know that it brought into our
little backwoods settlement, that which we
needed much more&mdash;hope and courage and
an interest in life. That was my first introduction
to the traveling library, but
during the years that have gone since
then, I have seen much of the work of
these little cases of books. While it is
true that the traveling library does not
always meet with as enthusiastic a reception
as our little settlement gave it that
winter, yet it always comes to our rural
communities as a help and inspiration. My
appreciation of the worth of the traveling
library has grown with the years."</p>

<p>"Once a library meant nothing but rows
of books and its influence was confined
to narrow limits. However with the establishment
of the traveling library, these
books have become veritable missionaries
penetrating to all sorts of dreary, isolated
places, carrying with them a culture and
a pleasure that will aid in illuminating
the long, dreary path of existence with
the color of happiness."</p>

<p>As one farmer's wife has it in another
locality, "Good books drive away neighborhood
discussion of the four deadly D's&mdash;Diseases,
Dress, Descendants and Domestics."</p>

<p>Olive Schreiner in her wonderful and
heart searching study of "Woman and Labor,"
has pointed out that at first woman
hunted with the man, and later when the
race settled in one spot, the woman was
the tiller of the soil and the man the hunter
and warrior. Then when man no longer
needed to hunt or fight, the woman
moved within the house and the man tilled
the fields. The woman became the isolated
one. Isolation is the menace of farm
life just as congestion is of city life. This
isolation has a depressing effect upon the
intellectual life of those who require the
stimulus of contact with others to keep
their minds active. The woman on the
farm, as Mr. Bailey has pointed out, is
apt to become a fatalist. Floods, drought,
storms, tornadoes, untimely frosts, backward
seasons, blight, predatory beasts, animal
and plant diseases render a season's
great labor of no avail, or destroy the
fruits of it within the hour. Along with
these perennial discouragements comes the
interminable round of getting up before
sunrise and cooking, baking, dishwashing,
sewing, mending, washing and ironing
clothes from day to day, week to week,
month to month, and year to year, with
additional work peculiar to the seasons,
such as at planting times, threshing and
harvesting, fruit gathering and preserving,
etc., etc., etc. The work of the farm is
carried on in direct connection with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
home, thus differing from nearly all the
large industries, such as manufacturing
and the like. The fact that agriculture is
still a family industry where the work and
home life are not separated, differentiates
it from life in the city with its lack of a
common business interest among all the
members of the family. This condition
tends to make rural life stable. The whole
family stay at home evenings and one
book is read aloud to the entire family
circle. We still find the big family in the
country where bridge whist and race-suicide&mdash;cause
and effect&mdash;are as yet unknown.
But the big family puts cares and responsibilities
upon the mother on the farm and
when one sees the "bent form, the tired
carriage, the warped fingers and the thin,
wrinkled features" of so many farmer's
wives, one does not at first see anything
but cruelty to animals in urging recreation
and reading upon such overburdened
women. But a brighter, industrial day is
at hand. From perpetual motion to hours
of reasonable industrial requirements the
daily working period of the farmer is coming
to be reduced by labor saving machinery.
The modern gasoline engine, to my
mind the most important contribution to
civilization and culture in recent times,
now pumps the water, saws and cuts the
wood, runs the lighting plant, the washing
machine, the milking machine, the cream
separator, the churn, the sewing machine,
the bread-mixer, the vacuum cleaner, the
lawn mower, the coffee grinder, the ice
cream freezer and even the egg-beater.
These, with the fireless cooker, have relieved
the housewife and made time for
reading and other recreation. Good roads,
rural free delivery, the interurban trolley
car, the automobile and the rural telephone
are removing the old-time isolation
and are making possible enjoyment and
a culture and refinement equal to that of
the business and professional classes of
the cities. One thing only is still withheld
from distinctly rural communities&mdash;the opportunity
to get good books.</p>

<p>It has been said so often it has become
a truism that the rural districts are the
seed bed from which the cities are stocked
with people. Upon the character of this
stock more than upon anything else does
the greatness of a nation and the quality
of its civilization ultimately depend. The
importance of doing something with and
for these people is paramount for the
farms furnish the cities not alone with material
products but with men and women.
Census returns indicate that cities are
gaining on the country all the time. We
who wish to stop the rural exodus must
co-operate with other agencies to make
farm life more attractive and this we can
do by opening our doors to farmers and
their wives, the makers of men. It is our
city's self-protection that there should
come from the farms strong, well-educated
minds, and we each should contribute our
share to this end. A Chinese philosopher
has said, "The well-being of a people is
like a tree; agriculture is its root, manufacturing
and commerce are its branches
and its life; if the root is injured, the
leaves fall, the branches break away and
the tree dies." State universities and other
free educational agencies are recognizing
the fact that not the few but all, farm
and city-bred alike, must be educated for
life and through life. Commencement day
is no longer the educational day of judgment
for the individual. Rural consolidated
high schools are being built to supplement
the little red schoolhouse. Libraries,
through extension of their service, must
aid in the great agrarian movement of the
day. We cannot all, perhaps, have the
ideal arrangement as worked out in Maryland
by Miss Titcomb. It may not be possible
to cover other states with book wagons
as Delaware proposes to do. We may
not accomplish the California ideal of the
county as the unit. We may not be able
to send traveling libraries on their beneficent
mission, but we each may try to let
down the bars at our own reservoirs so
that whosoever is athirst may come and
drink of the waters of life freely.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: Whenever I become
rash enough to venture a comment upon
any paper of Miss Stearns I always take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the precaution to do it before she presents
it; afterwards it is entirely superfluous.
Yet I venture to express a thought
which I am sure has occurred to you likewise;
that there is a very strong relationship
between the two papers which have
been presented this morning; that there
is cause and coming effect in that the one
activity of the library, as represented by
the first paper, is making possible the multiplication
of these various devices which
shall make for the woman on the farm the
new day of which Miss Stearns has prophesied.</p>

<p>During the last few years the library
has entered another new field, an unsuspected
field. Those of us who have had
an opportunity to go about to the various
institutions where the defectives and the
dependents and other unfortunates are incarcerated
have marvelled at the&mdash;shall
we say ignorance, which has been at the
bottom of the book work with these people.
But scientific methods have been introduced
and during the last few conferences
we have had something of the promise
which has now grown into fuller realization.
I shall ask Miss JULIA A. ROBINSON,
who has done strong, splendid
work in Iowa in this connection, to present
the next paper, on</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>BOOK INFLUENCES FOR DEFECTIVES
AND DEPENDENTS: HELPING
THOSE WHO CANNOT HELP
THEMSELVES</h2>


<p>Needy humanity divides itself into three
classes, those whom it is said the Lord
helps, those who will not and those who
cannot help themselves. In no form of
need, however, are we interested today
save that of the book, nor with the willfully
book needy.</p>

<p>For are not they served by the public
libraries which go even into the highways
and byways and wellnigh compel the uninterested
to come to the feast freely offered
to them? And though there are still
rural districts not yet supplied with public
or traveling libraries, many of them have
the ability to provide themselves with
books had they the desire.</p>

<p>But there are those, not always removed
by space but far removed by condition
from such privileges, because crime, weakness
or misfortune has deprived them of
their freedom and for the safety of society,
their own restoration to health or their
care and education they are detained behind
closed doors. These are the morally,
mentally and physically defective and the
dependent upon the bounty of the state.
With this class of helpless are we concerned,
with their needs and with what is being
done to bring to them the influence of
books. Of their needs let me speak briefly
while I define and locate the different
classes, giving a few figures which perhaps
may not be amiss in helping us to realize
their numbers.</p>

<p>Of the moral defectives 113,579 have
heard the grated doors of prison, penitentiary
or reformatory close behind them,
for some never to open. For others in a
few years perhaps these doors will swing
outward to freedom. Shall it be to useful
citizenship, or to become a greater menace
to society and again to be put behind
the bars? Most of these are men who are
employed during long working hours.
There is much time for idle thoughts during
those hours, in addition to evenings and
Sundays spent alone in locked cells. Large
is the opportunity here for the book in its
threefold mission of recreation, instruction
and inspiration to lives barren of
pleasure and interest.</p>

<p>But these are not all. We must add 22,900
juvenile delinquents found in the state
industrial and training schools of the United
States, boys and girls whose steps have
early found the downward path, in most
cases, I believe, because of the influences
into which life ushered them. But many
of these are yet within the years of susceptibility
and to the other upward influences
with which it is now sought to surround
them should be added the society of
books which will bring wholesome pleasure
while they present high standards and
make right living attractive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>These numbers are exceeded by the
mentally defective of whom 187,454, disturbed
or confused, dazed or depressed,
look through grated windows or sit in
shadowed corners of the insane hospitals.
To take their thoughts from themselves
and direct them into healthful channels
may mean a step toward mental healing
and adjustment. This books will often
do and to fail to furnish them may mean
to omit a remedial influence in their treatment.
Of the feebleminded, there are 20,199
in the institutions for that class of defectives.
With them the task is not so
encouraging, but a right to the pleasure of
books is theirs and should not be withheld.</p>

<p>There are 61,423 to whom the printed
page must speak for they hear no other
voice, and 44,310 to whose touch the raised
letters bring their message. Shut out
from so much which others enjoy shall
these be denied this means of recreation
and instruction?</p>

<p>The charitable institutions shelter 268,656
dependents which include the old, the
sick and the children in the state public
schools, orphanages and homes. The former
need books to cheer them in their
fight for health and strength, or to while
away the hours of waiting for their final
summons. The children need them not
only for the enjoyment which comes from
childhood reading, but as a means of development
of mind and character. I would
lay especial emphasis on the importance
of libraries in these and in the industrial
and training schools. Useful as books are
in the other institutions, there the help
which they bring is but to the readers
themselves. Here we have citizens in the
making and the state has not only the opportunity
of laying the foundations of
character, but by laying them deep and
broad and strong of receiving returns for
their efforts in intelligent and useful citizens.
To librarians I need not speak of
the value of books in giving the education
which makes for intelligence and the
ideals which make for usefulness.</p>

<p>To meet these needs what do the institutional
libraries offer? I shall not give
you figures which at best would be inaccurate
and incomplete, but such information
as could be obtained showing the efforts
which are being made to provide
books and reading for defectives and dependents,
the adequacy and suitability
of the libraries and their use of modern
library methods.</p>

<p>The list of states is incomplete, some
failing to respond, others giving vague information,
and an omission may not mean
that nothing is being done along this line.
What is given will serve to show the general
trend of interest in the work.</p>

<p>California plans to serve the institutions
through the county system of libraries,
but just how this is to be done or
whether any institutions have libraries or
have received assistance was not stated.</p>

<p>Colorado reports libraries in all the state
institutions, the best being that at the
state penitentiary where the visitors' fees
yield a considerable income which is used
for books. In Georgia two institutions
only have libraries, which are reported to
be neither well selected, kept up to date
nor administered according to modern
methods.</p>

<p>The only information received from
Idaho was that traveling libraries are sent
to the industrial school.</p>

<p>In Illinois libraries are reported in the
eighteen charitable and three penal institutions
of the state, though not all are
adequate or suitable in selection.</p>

<p>In Indiana several institutions receive
annual library appropriations ranging
from $1,000 down to $200. No institution
is without a library though not all are organized
or well selected or large enough
for the needs of the institution. The library
commission lends an organizer to
assist in this work and in some cases the
book selection and the affairs of the library
are put into the hands of the commission.
The librarian from the School
for Feeble Minded Youth will attend the
summer school.</p>

<p>In Iowa libraries exist in all of the fourteen
state institutions; all are classified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
organized and administered according to
approved library methods. All except the
penitentiaries have appropriations of $300
to $500 each for the purchase of books. In
the penitentiaries the fund received from
visitors' fees is used for this purpose. Reports
are made each month to the Board
of Control showing the reading done by
classes in each institution. A trained librarian
appointed by the Board of Control
gives all her time to the institutional libraries,
superintending the work, doing
the book selection, supplying the technical
knowledge, instructing the librarians
and stimulating the reading.</p>

<p>In Kentucky the prisons and hospitals
are under separate boards, neither of
which has done much for the libraries in
the institutions under their charge, but
both have the matter under consideration
and better things are looked for in the future.
The prison libraries are represented
as inadequate and unsuitable. One only
has a fund for the purchase of books and
that only $50. The only books in the
Houses of Reform are the traveling libraries
loaned by the library commission. Two
state hospitals have very small libraries
and no fund. One has about 800 volumes
and an annual fund of $250.</p>

<p>The chairman of the Board of Control
of State Institutions in Kansas writes that
considerable interest is taken in providing
suitable reading for the dependents and
defectives of that state and that the institutions
are urged to systematic work,
but does not state whether all have libraries.</p>

<p>The Maine Insane Hospital has an endowment
which yields an income of about
$600 annually which is expended for books
for the general library, periodicals and
medical books. According to the chaplain
of the Maine state prison "additions are
made to that library from three sources, a
few volumes by purchase, some by gifts
from individuals, but mostly by gifts from
the state library of <b>books no longer useful
in the traveling libraries</b>."</p>

<p>The Massachusetts prison commission
reports libraries in substantially all the
prisons. The larger ones are classified.</p>

<p>Michigan has a state appropriation for
books. All the institutions have libraries
of some kind, but none are classified or
organized according to modern methods.
The selections are made by the state librarian.</p>

<p>Minnesota has also an appropriation for
books in the state institutions. The public
library organizer from the Library
Commission pays regular visits to the institutions,
selects the books and supervises
the work. Not all are classified and several
need new books. The two asylums for incurable
insane and the hospital for inebriates
have only traveling libraries.</p>

<p>In Missouri five institutions have no libraries.
Traveling libraries are sent to
the insane hospitals. In the boys' training
school the library is managed without
system. If a boy wants a book the superintendent
takes what may be at hand
and gives it to him.</p>

<p>Nebraska has a state appropriation of
$2,000 made directly to the Library Commission
to be expended by them for the
thirteen institutional libraries. This is
used for books, supplies and periodicals except
in two institutions which supply their
own magazines. The institutions are asked
to furnish cases only and some one to loan
the books. Books are selected by the commission
and prepared for circulation in
the commission office.</p>

<p>In New Hampshire the legislature makes
an appropriation for the libraries in the
state prisons and state hospitals.</p>

<p>The February number of New York
Libraries was made an institutional number
and among other things contained
reports from the institutional libraries
of the state showing libraries in all
but two or three institutions which are
supplied by traveling libraries. The following
editorial comment is made on these
libraries: "Of the thirty-six institutions
from whose libraries detailed reports are
herewith presented, there are not more
than two or three whose library conditions
would be regarded as up to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
standard commonly expected and demanded
for public libraries. For not one
of them does the state provide a sufficient
appropriation for the attainment of such a
standard." The committee appointed by
the State Library Association on libraries
in the penal institutions in the state of
New York in making their report recommend
a change of title for the committee
to include the charitable as well as the
penal and reformatory institutions and a
request that the legislature pass an act authorizing
the appointment of a supervising
librarian for the state institutions.</p>

<p>The libraries in many of the state institutions
of North Carolina are reported so
small and poorly cared for that they are
practically useless. The School for the
Blind has a separate library building called
the Laura Bridgman Library and there is
a good library in the School for the Deaf
classified by the teachers. The value of
this work is appreciated by the Board of
Charities but there is a lack of funds.</p>

<p>The North Dakota Library Commission
has recently been asked to assist in selecting
books and organizing a library for the
state penitentiary where a thousand dollars
is to be expended. No libraries exist
in the other state institutions.</p>

<p>The Oregon Library Commission reports
libraries in all the state institutions except
one just opened. All the institutions are
located at Salem and receive direct assistance
from the commission in organization
and book selection and management of
their libraries. Purchases are made from
a general fund. All are reported adequate
except one to be made so. Three are classified
and the rest are to be.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has libraries in all the
state institutions but none are organized,
classified or administered according to accepted
library methods. The Library Commission
takes the position (wisely it seems
to me) that their part lies in stirring up
the boards in charge of the institutions to
active interest in these libraries, rather
than themselves mixing in the affairs of
another organization, though as yet little
has been accomplished in that direction.</p>

<p>Tennessee has a library in the School for
the Blind, the School for the Deaf and the
state prison, but none in the insane hospitals.
These are organized and classified
to a limited extent only.</p>

<p>From the biennial report of the Texas
Library Commission I quote the following:
"Only a few of the institutions have libraries
and as a rule these are small and
without reference to the purpose they are
to serve. Some have nominal librarians,
but none trained and a library without a
trained librarian is like a piano without
a pianist, valuable, even expensive, but of
little use or pleasure."</p>

<p>In Vermont an appropriation of $500 was
made in 1910 and $200 is now appropriated
annually. This is divided between the libraries
in the State Prison, House of Correction,
State Industrial School and Insane
Hospital and is under the control of the
Free Public Library Commission which
purchases the books and oversees the cataloging.
A card catalog of each institution
is kept at the commission office. The State
Prison also has a printed catalog.</p>

<p>Washington has a library of some kind
in all its institutions, but in none is it a
real factor. None are classified.</p>

<p>In Wisconsin no institution is wholly
without a library. They are organized and
classified in a limited way only. The commission
assists to some extent in book selection.</p>

<p>From these reports we may draw the following
conclusions: (1) Libraries of some
kind exist in many state institutions. (2)
Probably most of these libraries are only
partially adequate, if not wholly inadequate
and unsuitable. (3) Few are organized
or administered according to the best
methods, have proper rooms or a librarian
in charge to render even their present
collection useful. (4) In a few states only
is there trained supervision or systematic
library work undertaken in the institutions.
(5) Where appropriations are made
they are seldom sufficient to properly
maintain the libraries.</p>

<p>The responsibility for this work lies (1)
with the governing bodies, the Boards of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Control and other boards to whom is committed
the care and welfare of the defectives
and dependents of the state and the
superintendents of the various institutions
who are directly responsible for this care,
and (2) with the librarians entrusted with
library extension and the carrying of
books to those who would otherwise be
bookless, the state library commissions.</p>

<p>That the superintendents partially appreciate
the value of the book is evidenced
by library beginnings in many institutions
and their readiness to co-operate in movements
toward the improvement and increased
usefulness of the libraries. But
they are busy men with many departments
on heart and mind and the boards
are charged with many interests.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that it is
the librarians who have recognized the importance
of these libraries and the fact that
if they are to become a real force in the
institutions the work must be given to
some one whose business it shall be, who
is trained for it, and who has the time to
give it proper attention.</p>

<p>As few institutions are yet in a position
to individually employ a trained librarian,
the solution of the problem has seemed to
be a joint or supervising librarian for all
the institutions of a state or of a kind in
a state.</p>

<p>Iowa through the influence of Miss Tyler
and Mr. Brigham was the first to undertake
this work and is still the only state
in which institutional library work is done
by a librarian working under the Board of
Control and giving all her time to the institutions.
The other states having institutional
supervision are Indiana, Minnesota,
where an officer from the commission
gives part and Nebraska the whole of her
time to the institutional libraries, and Oregon,
Michigan and Vermont where the
work seems to be done directly by the secretary.</p>

<p>If the Board of Control and the institutional
heads are not affected by party
changes the advantage, it seems to me, lies
with the librarian employed by them, who
goes into the institutions with authority
from the board to do what needs to be
done and not as a guest, who is sometimes
unwelcome. The book selection can thus
be better guarded and I believe books purchased
with institution funds will be better
cared for by both officers and inmates
than those received by donation. Appropriations
are also likely to be larger if
made directly to each institution than if
made in a lump sum to the commission.</p>

<p>The initiative, however, will undoubtedly
lie with the library commission and the
importance of institutional library work is
such that should the boards fail to use
their opportunity it may become the part
of the library commission to at least inaugurate
the work, which having begun
they will probably be allowed to continue.</p>

<p>Before closing may I emphasize very
briefly three important points in connection
with institutional library work. I wish
I might elaborate both these and the other
points which I have touched so hurriedly,
but time forbids.</p>

<p>1. If the libraries are to become a real
factor for good in institutional work, the
book selection must be differentiated to
meet the needs of the different classes of
readers, and great care used to exclude the
harmful and include helpful books only.
2. To make these libraries most useful
there should be suitable rooms, not only
for the proper shelving of the books, but
for use as reading rooms where the atmosphere
of book lined walls may yield its
helpful influence and prepare the way for
public library use by the boys and girls
at least when the opportunity shall come
to them. 3. Though there may be a supervising
librarian in the field, there
should be a competent institutional librarian
who shall not only do the routine
work, but have sufficient knowledge of
books and readers to be able to fit them
together and sufficient time to do the work
properly.</p>

<p>Thus shall these libraries, not only bring
brightness and cheer to lives otherwise
dull and colorless, for</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: I am very glad to be
able to announce that Miss Rathbone has
kindly consented to exhibit some extremely
interesting charts which have been prepared
and exhibited in connection with the
work of the library school at Pratt and I
am sure that all of you will miss something
if you do not avail yourselves of the opportunity
which is here presented to see them
and to hear the explanation concerning
them.</p>

<p>Miss RATHBONE: I am very glad indeed
to tell you a little about our exhibition
because we found it an interesting
thing to do and the people who saw it were
interested in it. The genesis of the matter
was this: When Miss Alice Tyler was
at the school this spring we were speaking
about budget and other exhibitions and she
said, "I do wish librarians could find some
way of graphically presenting library work
so that people could understand it as the
child welfare work has been presented."
That remark of hers, coupled with the fact
the library school has never taken part
in the exhibition that Pratt Institute has
held for a great many years, at the end of
the third term, suggested to me the idea
of putting the problem to the class of devising
an exhibition that should be a visual
presentation of the school course and also
of library work in general in a form that
would be interesting and intelligible to the
general public. After a visit to the Bureau
of Municipal Research, where Dr. Allen
gave them a talk on the value of graphic
presentation of facts, I told the students
that they were to have the entire responsibility
of the planning and execution of
this exhibition as a problem in the library
administration seminar. It was, of course,
an experiment but I was sufficiently convinced
of its success after the class made
their first and only report of progress, to
invite the staffs of the neighboring
public libraries to the exhibition. When
the material was assembled and installed
it created a good deal of interest both in
the Institute among the librarians who
saw it, and, best of all, on the part of the
public at large. We had about five hundred
visitors in the four days it was open
and it seemed to awaken in the minds of
the people who saw it some conception of
what library work means. We heard many
comments of this kind, "Well, now that I
understand the work the library does, I
am going to use it more intelligently." One
high school boy said, "Gee! I've had an
awful time trying to use this library before,
but I think I know what it is about
now." That sort of a thing made me realize
that the exhibition might be of value
to some of you as showing one way by
which people could be interested in the
actual work done in a library, so I wrote to
see if space could be had to install it
here. It was too late, however, so I simply
brought up a few of the charts as examples.</p>

<p>The exhibition began with the technical
work of the library&mdash;the progress of a
book through the various steps was illustrated
by a ladder the rungs of which were
labeled, Book Selection, Ordering, Receiving,
Accessioning, Classification, etc. Books
were shown running toward this "Library
Ladder," nimbly climbing the rungs, while
at the top they acquire wings and fly "off
to the public." This chart hung over a
table on which the successive operations
were shown in detail the same book being
used as an illustration throughout.
The successive steps were numbered to
correspond to the rungs of the ladder. For
example, Book Selection was shown by a
group including the A. L. A. Booklist, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Book Review Digest and two or three of
the reviews. The descriptive card read
"No. 1. These are a few of the aids in
book selection."</p>

<p>Following that was a chart (exhibiting
it) to illustrate the utility of classification,
on which was presented a group of ten
scientific books unclassified, followed by
the same ten in D. C. order, with the question,
"In which group would it be easier
to find the books on insects." That was
followed by another exhibit to prove the
utility of subject cataloging. Two copies
of the same book were obtained, one new
and the other quite worn, the book being
Gleason White's "Practical designing,"
which is made up of a number of papers
on minor arts, by different authorities.
The new book with a single author card
lay on the table surrounded by radiating
interrogation points, questions unanswered,
and over the book hung this inscription:
"This book looks new. Why? Because nobody
knows what is in it. It is poorly cataloged."
The worn copy lay on the next
table and radiating from that were a number
of questions with the catalog cards
that answer them attached. Over that
was the screed: "This book shows wear.
Why? Because it can be reached from
twenty-four sources. It is well cataloged."
People who had not known before what a
catalog meant studied that thing out and
the change of expression which came to
their faces when they saw the new book
and the worn book side by side and understood
what it signified was delightful. It
struck home.</p>

<p>The work of the reference department
was tellingly illustrated by an arch in
which the reference library was the keystone,
all intellectual activities depending
on it.</p>

<p>(Miss Rathbone then exhibited various
other charts and described them in detail.)</p>

<p>In addition to this, children's work, the
field work, the courses in binding and
printing, the making of reading lists, the
course in fiction were represented.</p>

<p>Altogether we felt that graphic illustration
of library work was not only possible
but distinctly worth while and that
the exhibition had done a good work in
educating the library's public, as well as
the class, and we expect to make it a permanent
feature of the year's work.</p>

<h2>FOURTH GENERAL SESSION<br />


(Thursday morning, June 26, 1913)</h2>

<p>The PRESIDENT: We begin this morning
the fourth session of this Thirty-fifth
Annual Conference and I shall ask the
chairman of the Committee on Library
Administration to submit at this time his
report.</p>

<p>(Dr. Bostwick here read the report.)</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: You have heard the
report of the Committee on Administration.
This report embodies some recommendations
which it seems to the Chair
should be acted upon. Therefore the
recommendation which suggests the appointment
of a committee to undertake certain
work will be referred to the Executive
Board for their attention, as, in accordance
with the terms of the Constitution,
it devolves upon the Executive
Board to name the committees. The report
will be printed in the proceedings.</p>

<p>(This report is printed with other committee
reports. See page <a href="#Page_126">126</a>.)</p>

<p>Mr. RANCK: Mr. President, there is
just one item, about questionnaires, if I
may have a moment to state it, that I
think the committee has not referred to.
It is a matter of some importance to us
at our library. I think we answer, in the
form of questions of one kind or other,
not all from libraries however, about a
thousand a year. I should like to insist
on the importance, when a blank is sent
out on which spaces are left for writing
in the answers, that a duplicate be sent so
that a library can keep a copy of the answers
sent. Again and again we have to
copy them because we feel it very important
that we should know just exactly what
we are sending out in that way. And if
possible, in the printing of that report
I should like to see the committee include<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
that, if they are willing to accept the suggestion.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: The suggestion is a
very good one.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: I feel like congratulating
you this morning upon the program
for this fourth session, the general theme
being: "Children and young people; their
conditions at home, in the school and in
the library." No matter how splendid a
structure may be reared nor how beautiful
it may be, without an adequate foundation
it is most insecure. We have learned
to realize in library work that we must
begin at the beginning if our work is to
have any perpetuity or any permanent
result. We feel that, splendid and admirable
in every way as the work with the
adults is, that that alone is not enough.
That work invites, as it deserves, our respect
and admiration, but in the work with
children is centered our affection. And
when I say this I do not mean to intimate
for one moment that that work is
enveloped in sentiment. I believe most
firmly that the work with children is constructive
work of the very highest order.
If there are any in this audience who
doubt that I am sure that after we shall
have heard the papers of this morning
the doubts will be dispelled. We shall
have this work in three volumes this
morning, the first volume comprising two
chapters. The title of the first volume is
The Education of Children and the Conservation
of their Interests, and Chapter
One will be contributed by Miss FAITH E.
SMITH, of the Chicago public library, on</p>

<h2>I. CHANGING CONDITIONS OF CHILD
LIFE</h2>


<p>It is now twenty-eight years since some
one first recognized the fact that children
needed to have special libraries or special
collections of books in libraries, and thereupon
opened a children's reading room in
New York City.</p>

<p>Some of the conditions affecting child
life today existed then, but we know more
about them now than we did then. We
have many specialists in sociological fields
who are making investigations, compiling
statistics, drawing conclusions, and telling
other people how to make the world a better
place. Our rapid industrial development
is producing many problems concerning
child welfare, some of which are of
vital interest to us as library workers;
others we may well leave to playground
associations, juvenile courts, health bureaus,
social settlements, child labor committees,
schools and churches. It is not
ours to change housing conditions or to do
away with child labor, but it is ours to
meet these conditions, to be god-parents
to those whose natural parents are not inclined
or not able to guide their reading,
to present to the children's minds other
worlds than the tenement or street, and
to give to children worn with daily labor
such books as will be within their grasp,
and will help them to permanent happiness.</p>

<p>In 1885 when a children's library was
opened by Miss Hanaway in New York
City, there were fewer means of recreation
than there are now. There were no motion-picture
shows, no children's theaters, no
municipal recreation parks with free gymnasiums,
swimming pools and baths. Child
labor had only begun to be exploited by
large manufacturing establishments (1879).
Then there were more homes, permanent
abiding places, where there was room for
children both to work and to play. There
was more family life, where father and
mother and children gathered about the
evening lamp, and father read aloud while
mother sewed and the children listened, or
where each member of the family had his
own book in which to lose himself. There
were daily duties for each of the children,
the performance of which gave them training
in habits of responsibility.</p>

<p>Today such conditions may be found
only rarely, except in small cities and villages.</p>

<p>Congestion in large cities has led even
well-to-do families to live in apartment
houses. In Chicago this sort of life began
only thirty-four years ago, and today one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>-third
of all that city live in residences
having six families per main entrance.
(Chicago City Club-Housing exhibit.) This
tendency to apartment life means the loss
of the joy of ownership, the feeling of not-at-homeness
and consequent restlessness,
due to frequent change of environment.</p>

<p>Book agents say that they cannot sell
books to families in apartment houses, because
they have no room for books. Scott
Nearing in his "Woman and social progress"
regrets "the woeful lack of provision
for the needs of the child in the construction
of the modern city home. Huge real
estate signs advertise the bathroom, bedrooms,
the dining room and kitchen, the
library, and reception hall. But where is
the children's room? Owners do not care
to rent houses to people having children.
Many of the apartment houses exclude
children as they exclude dogs or other objectionable
animals." Yet we say, and
rightly, that this is the century of the child.</p>

<p>The complexity of modern life, the tendency
to materialism, the multiplicity of interests,
have deterred many parents from
being actively concerned in the growth of
the minds and the souls of their children.
This part of their development is being
left to teachers, church workers, leaders
of boys' and girls' clubs, etc. There is
not time for reading aloud to children at
home, and little concern is manifested by
many intelligent parents, regarding their
children's choice of books. The "poor,
neglected children of the rich" are not allowed
to use the public library books, because
there may be germs hidden among
the leaves. They may have their own
books, but they are denied the joy of reading
a book that some other boy or girl has
read and pronounced "swell".</p>

<p>Because of this lack of concern on the
part of parents in children's reading, are
we not justified in our hitherto condemned
paternalism?</p>

<p>Home life among the very poor in the
congested districts of our large cities is
often such as is not worth the name. The
practice of taking lodgers which prevails
among some foreign elements of the population,
means the undermining of family
life, and often the breaking down of domestic
standards. (Veiler, "Housing reform,"
p. 33.) "Thousands of children in
Chicago alone are being exposed to the demoralizing
influences of overcrowded
rooms, of inadequate sanitary provisions,
and of unavoidable contact with immoral
persons."</p>

<p>"Bad housing is associated with the
worst conditions in politics, poverty, population
density, tuberculosis, and retardation
in the schools. It is directly related
to many cases of delinquency of boys and
girls, who have been brought before the
juvenile court." (Breckenridge and Abbott,
"The delinquent child and the home.")</p>

<p>Furthermore wrong home conditions result
in driving children to the street. The
child who finds no room at home to do the
things that he wishes to do, not even room
to study his school lessons, is inevitably
forced into the street, "not only in the
day time, but as common observation
shows, until late at night, not only in good
weather but in foul." Here he grows up,
and is educated "with fatal precision." The
saloon and its victims, the hoboes and
their stories, criminals dodging the police,
lurid signboards, a world of money-getting,
all become only too familiar to him. Sin
loses its sinfulness, and gains in interest
and excitement.</p>

<p>Are we placing our attractive children's
rooms, clean and orderly, adorned with
flowers and fine pictures, where they may
be readily seen from the street, where picture
books placed in the windows may vie
in alluring powers with the nickel-novel
window displays?</p>

<p>The boy of the street may be a member
of a boys' gang, and if so, this becomes
one of the great influences acting upon his
life, either for good or for ill. Mr. Puffer
makes the statement that three-fourths of
all boys are members of gangs. (Puffer,
"The boy and his gang," p. 9.)</p>

<p>Those boys are fortunate whose gang is
an organized body efficiently directed, such
as the Boys' Scout Patrol. This, Mr. Puffer
says, "is simply a boys' gang, systematized,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
overseen, affiliated with other like bodies,
made efficient and interesting, as boys
alone could never make it, and yet everywhere,
from top to bottom a gang." Here
lies an opportunity for co-operation on the
part of the library, and many are the interests
awakened by the Boy Scout movement
which may be encouraged by the library.</p>

<p>Another influence constantly appealing to
children of the street as well as to others,
is the glaring advertisement of the moving-picture
show. Moving pictures are now
the most important form of cheap amusement
in this country; they reach the
young, immigrants, family groups, the
formative and impressionable section of
our cities, as no other form of amusement,
and can not but be vital influences for good
or ill. In 1910 it was estimated that more
than half a million children attended motion
pictures daily. (Juvenile Protective
Assn. of Chicago, "Five and ten-cent theaters"&mdash;pamphlet.)</p>

<p>Is it not possible for the library to make
permanent whatever good, though fleeting,
impression may be made by educational
pictures or pictures from great books, by
co-operating with the picture shows, and
being ready to supply to the children
copies of the stories, nature books, or histories
to which the children may have been
attracted by the motion pictures?</p>

<p>During the meetings this week our interest
in the adult immigrants and their relation
to the library has been aroused and
augmented, and it has been proven conclusively
that the solution of the immigrant
problem must of necessity rest with
the children. The change in the type of
immigration in recent years from a large
percentage of English-speaking and Scandinavian
races having a low percentage of
illiteracy, to a leadership among races of
eastern and southern Europe, with a very
high percentage of illiteracy, has had a decided
influence on standards of living.</p>

<p>These people of other lands do not adapt
themselves to American ways as readily
as their children. Many do not know the
English language, they do not stir far from
home or from work, and have few new experiences.
"Many things which are familiar
to the child in the facts of daily intercourse,
in the street or in the school, remain
unintelligible to the father and
mother. It has become a commonplace
that this cheap wisdom on the part of the
boy or girl leads to a reversal of the relationship
between parent and child. The
child who knows English is the interpreter
who makes the necessary explanations for
the mother to the landlord, the grocer, the
sanitary inspector, the charity visitor, and
the teacher or truant officer. It is the child
again who often interviews the boss, finds
the father a job, and sees him through the
onerous task of 'joining the union.' The
father and mother grow accustomed to
trusting to the child's version of what
'they all do in America,' and gradually
find themselves at a disadvantage in trying
to maintain parental control. The
child develops a sense of superiority
towards the parent and a resulting disregard
of those parental warnings which, although
they are not based on American
experience, rest on common notions of
right and wrong, and would, if heeded,
guard the child." (Breckenridge and Abbott,
"The delinquent child and the home.")</p>

<p>Can books not teach children to honor
their father and mother, and "that the head
and the hoof of the Law, and the haunch
and the hump is obey"?</p>

<p>We are told that one of the causes of
crime among the children of foreigners is
transmitted ambition. "The father left the
homeland because he was not satisfied....
He worked hard and saved money,
that the dream of better things might be
realized.... The son manifests this innate
tendency by a desire to excel, by the
longings to rise and be masterful, the ambition
to beat the other fellow&mdash;these are
the motives which impel him to an intensive
life that carries him to excess and
transgression." (Roberts, "The new immigration,"
p. 325.)</p>

<p>It is for us to interest this ambition and
turn it into right channels. We may also
discover what special interests are uppermost
in the minds of those of different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
nationalities, things they wish their
children to love, traditions they have
cherished, and which we may help the
children to cherish.</p>

<p>Driven by necessity or by the spirit
of the age, the immigrant quickly develops
a strong ambition for acquiring
money, supposing that he landed on our
shores without that impelling force.
One of the consequences is that he
withdraws his children from school as
soon as they are old enough to secure
their working papers. "To the Italian
peasant, who, as a gloriously street laborer
begins to cherish a vision of prosperity,
it matters little whether his girls
go to school or not. It is, on the contrary,
of great importance that a proper
dower be accumulated to get them good
husbands; and to take them from school
to put them to work is, therefore, only
an attempt to help them accomplish this
desirable end." (Breckenridge and Abbott.)</p>

<p>In 1911 the National Child Labor Committee
conducted an investigation of tenement
house work in New York City.
Among 163 families visited having 213
children, 196 children ranging in ages from
3&frac12; to 14 years were working on nuts,
brushes, dolls' clothes, or flowers. These
are truly not the good old-fashioned domestic
industries in which children received
a good part of their education. Those
working in factories and tenement sweat
shops, where labor is specialized and subdivided
into innumerable operations, do not
get the variety of employment that cultivates
resourcefulness, alertness, endurance
and skill. (Child labor bulletin, Nov.,
1912.)</p>

<p>We cannot expect these children, with
bodies retarded in development by overwork,
and without proper nourishment, to
be able to take the same mental food that
is pleasing to other children of the same
age, who have had all necessary physical
care.</p>

<p>The hours when working children, those
engaged in gainful occupations, and those
who are helping in the homes, are free for
recreation, are in the evening and on Sunday.
Are we placing our most skilled
workers on duty at these times, and are
we opening our story hours and reading
clubs on Sunday afternoons, when the
minds of these children are most receptive
of good things, when the children are
dressed in their good clothes, their self-respect
is high, and they are free from responsibility?</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that the need of
money is not the only cause of the exodus
from school that occurs in the grades. An
investigation made by the Commissioner of
Labor in 1910 (Condition of woman and
child wage-earners in the U. S., vol. 7), examining
the conditions of white children
under 16, in five representative cities,
showed that of those children interviewed,
169 left school because earnings were necessary,
and 165 because dissatisfied with
school. The Chicago Tribune (Nov. 11,
1912) stated that in 1912 there were in Chicago
over 23,000 children between 14 and
16 years of age, who were not in school.
Over half of these were unemployed, and
the remainder had employment half the
time at ill-paid jobs, teaching little and
leading nowhere. In 1912 there were
34,000 children of Philadelphia not in
school, and only 13,000 were employed.
(Philadelphia City Club Bulletin, Dec. 27,
1912.)</p>

<p>The curriculum of our public schools is
in a transitional stage. The complaint of
parents who take their children from
school before they have completed the
high school course, is that it does not teach
them to earn a living. The desire of commercial
men is to have such courses introduced
as will lessen the need of apprentice
training in their establishments. These
changes may help boys and girls to earn a
living, but those courses which teach them
how to live may be sacrificed. Man does
not live by bread alone. Mrs. Ella Flagg
Young says, "The training must also implant
in the mind a desire to become something&mdash;I
mean by that an ideal.... It
must make the boys and girls able to know
that they have possibilities of greater development
along many lines." This sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of training is within the sphere of the library
as well as within that of the schools.</p>

<p>The children in the rural districts (which
the 1910 census interprets as meaning people
of towns of less than 2,500 inhabitants,
and people of the country) are the library's
great opportunity. In these districts may
be found the old-fashioned home life, where
parents are glad to be aided in the direction
of their children's reading. There are
fewer distractions in the way of amusements.
Books are not seen by the thousands,
until they have become so confusing
that one knows not what to read or where
to begin. Homes are owned, instead of
rented, and a library worker is not liable to
lose her group of children each first of
May.</p>

<p>The pleasures of city life have been
made easily accessible to children and
grown people by means of trolley lines,
good roads, telephones, etc., and the music
of grand opera has been carried to the
country homes by means of talking
machines. Still the distractions of modern
life have not absorbed a large part of the
everyday life of the children, so that their
minds may be appealed to along the line
of their natural interests. As Miss Stearns
told us yesterday, there is less of drudgery
in farm life today than there was thirty
years ago, and children have more time
for study and reading; but they need direction
and assistance.</p>

<p>The consensus of opinion among writers
on rural sociology is that the great need
of the people of the country is more education;
education that will make farming
more scientific and efficient, and less fatiguing,
education that will help boys and
girls to find amusement in the life about
them; education that will guide that passion
for nature which every normal child
possesses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Because children today have many more
opportunities for recreation than they had
thirty years ago; because many leave
school long before they have acquired the
education that will teach them how to live,
as well as how to earn a living; because
in many homes mothers and fathers cannot
train their children in American ideals
of citizenship, which they themselves do
not understand; because in other homes
the physical needs of children are held to
be of most importance, while mental and
moral needs are left to the care of teachers
and social workers, the time seems ripe for
the library to place emphasis upon the
educational side of its work, rather than
upon the recreative. Let the recreative be
truly recreative, giving relaxation, new
visions, higher standards of living, and
increased belief in one's self, but let the
educational work meet the children's needs,
increase their efficiency, teach them how
to live, and to be of service in the world's
work.</p>

<p>Mr. Bostwick, in the Children's section,
mentioned three eras in library work with
children; first, the era of children's books
in libraries; second, era of children's
room; third, era of children's department.
These concerned books and organization,
the machinery of getting the books to the
children. We think we have learned something
about children's books, and we know
approved methods of administration. Possibly
we are now on the verge of the fourth
era, when we shall know <span class="sans">children</span>. Not
the child with a capital C, a laboratory
specimen, but living children, with hearts
and souls. Do we know the conditions
under which the children of our own neighborhood
live? Do we understand their interests,
and are we sanely sympathetic?</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: We are glad to get
Chapter Two: How the Library is Meeting
these Conditions, by Miss GERTRUDE
E. ANDRUS, of the Seattle public library.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>II. HOW THE LIBRARY IS MEETING
THE CHANGING CONDITIONS OF
CHILD LIFE</h2>


<p>Every month, if the mails are regular,
we receive assurance that the public library
is an integral part of public education,
and the complacence with which we
accept this assurance gives ample opportunity
to our critics for those slings and
arrows with which they are so ready. Ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
and ideals of education are rapidly changing
and it behooves the librarian, and more
particularly the children's librarian, to see
that she keeps pace with the forward
movement and that the ridicule of her
censors is really undeserved.</p>

<p>The old idea of education was to abolish
illiteracy, "to develop the ability, improve
the habits, form the character of
the individual, so that he might prosper
in his life's activities and conform to certain
social standards of conduct."</p>

<p>The new idea of education is that of
social service, to train children to be not
mere recipients, but distributors, not merely
to increase their ability to care for
themselves, but also their ability to care
for others and for the state.</p>

<p>This perhaps sounds a note of the millennium,
but we have been told to hitch
our wagon to a star and although the star
proves a restive steed and often lands
us in the ditch, we travel further while
the connection holds than we should in
a long, continuous journey harnessed to a
dependable but slow-going snail.</p>

<p>It may seem a far cry from these comments
on education to the topic of my paper:
How the library meets the changing
conditions of child-life, but in reality it is
only a step, for just as in philanthropy the
emphasis is placed more and more upon
prevention rather than remedy, so in education
the task is coming to be the training
of the good citizen rather than the
correction of the bad citizen. And if the library
is, as we are anxious to claim, an integral
part of public education, it must
have a share, however small, in the preventive
policy of modern educators, which will
in time effect a change in present social
evils. Unless the library, as it meets these
constantly changing conditions, can do
something to improve them and to make
the improvement stable, it has small claim
to be included in the educational scheme
of things.</p>

<p>In the conditions of child life which
Miss Smith has outlined, the breaking up
of the home is the most serious handicap
which the children have to face. It is on
this account that all social agencies working
with children endeavor, so far as each
is able, to supply an "illusory home" and
to give, each in its own capacity, the training
in various lines which ought in a normal
home to come under the direction of
the mother and father.</p>

<p>There is a spreading belief in the value
of reading but there is a woeful lack of
knowledge as to what should be read, and
the children's library therefore fills a double
r&ocirc;le; it provides books which it would
be impossible for many of the children to
get otherwise, and it selects these books
with thoughtful care of the special place
each one has to fill, so that it becomes a
counselor, not only to the children but to
those parents who are anxious to assume
their just responsibility in the guidance of
their children's reading, and yet feel their
inability to breast unaided the yearly torrent
of children's books. The stimulation
of this feeling of responsibility on the part
of parents is one of the most effective
means at the library's disposal of striking
a blow at the root of the whole matter, for
it is on the indifference of the parents that
the blame for many juvenile transgressions
should rest, which is now piled high
upon the shoulders of the children.</p>

<p>In this connection mention should be
made of the home library, the most social
of all the library's activities. This small
case of books, located in a home in the
poorer quarters of a city and placed in
charge of a paid or volunteer library assistant
has been proved to be a potent force in
the life of the neighborhood, for the
"friendly visitor," if she be of the proper
stuff, is not merely a circulator of books,
she is an all-round good neighbor to whom
come both children and mothers for help
in their big and little problems, so that
the results have proved to be "better family
standards, greater individual intelligence,
and more satisfactory neighborhood
conditions."</p>

<p>But even granting that the mothers and
fathers show a deep concern in what their
children read, the connection between
books and children is often left of neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>sity
to the children's librarian who is selected
with special reference to her adaptability
to this particular kind of work. Now,
no matter how strong a personality this
young woman may possess, no matter how
high her literary standards, nor how far-reaching
her moral influence, it is obviously
impossible for her to come in contact
with more than a few of the children
in her community. And in order to provide
that intimacy with books from which we
wish no child to be debarred, she must
depend not alone upon her children's room,
beautiful and homelike though that may
be, but she must place her resources at the
disposal of other educational agencies, all
of which are working toward a common
end. Of these the most powerful is the
school, and through the lessons in the use
of the public library, through the collections
of books placed in the schoolrooms,
and most of all through the influence of
the teacher, the public library will touch
the lives of thousands of children who
might otherwise be in ignorance of its resources,
and who through this contact will
receive a vivid impression of their share as
citizens in a great public institution. In
this correlation of school and library care
must be taken to place an equal emphasis
upon the library as a place for recreation
as well as a place for study.</p>

<p>Contrary to the teachings of our Puritan
forefathers, we are growing more keenly
alive to the imperative need of healthful
recreation as a means of combating existing
social conditions, and our great cities
and our little villages are gradually making
provision for the gratification of the
desire of the people to play. Nowhere does
the library find an alliance more satisfactory
than with these play-centers, for it is
in the union of the physical and mental development
that education comes to its fullest
fruition and the striving to instill
"imagination in recreation" can find no
better field than in these places where
not only muscles but minds may be exercised.</p>

<p>These are the well-worn channels
through which the children's library pours
its stream of books into a thirsty land,
channels into which run the tributary
streams of deposit stations, churches, settlements,
telegraph offices, newsboys'
homes, and all the rest which it would only
weary you to repeat.</p>

<p>We are constantly engaged in deepening
and broadening these channels because
we believe in the power of books to develop
character and to broaden the vision
of that "inward eye which is the bliss of
solitude." Now the book that does this
most effectively is the book behind which
lies some personality. We all know the
popularity of "the book Teacher says is
good." But the problem of the children's
librarian is not limited as is the teacher's
to two or three dozen children. She must
lay her plans to reach hundreds of children
and she can do this only by dealing
with the children in groups: in other
words, in clubs, reading circles, and story-tellings.</p>

<p>The natural group of child life is the
boys' gang or the girls' clique which offer
unlimited opportunities for good or ill. The
tendency of a <b>neglected</b> group is to develop
strongly a regard for the interests of the
individual group and make it antagonistic,
if not actually dangerous, to the larger
group of society.</p>

<p>The possibility of touching children's interests,
enlarging their horizon, and influencing
their ideals through these groups
has been utilized in the club work of many
libraries. Although all library clubs lead
eventually to books, the way may be a
circuitous one and baseball, basketry, and
dramatics may be met on the way. But
aside from the book interest, without
which no library club can be considered
legitimate, there is the opportunity of
guiding the activities of the group by
means of debate work or similar interests
so that their attention may be directed outside
of their immediate environment and
made to include the greater possibilities of
the larger social group.</p>

<p>Very often in girls' clubs the charitable
impulse is strong and may be so led as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
to instill a very thoughtful sympathy for
others.</p>

<p>It is for the things we know best that we
have the most sympathy and the truest
devotion, and we may expect real patriotism
and an active civic conscience only
when we have taught the children to know
thoroughly their country and the city in
which they live. This is some of the most
valuable work that is being done by libraries,
and it may be well passed on, as
has been done in Newark, to become a part
of the school curriculum. Indifference to
the fatherland is not the best foundation
on which to build the superstructure of
American patriotism, and the confused and
homesick foreigner welcomes with gratitude
the books in his own tongue provided
by the library, the opportunity to use the
library's auditorium for the meetings of
his clubs with unpronounceable names, the
respect with which his especial predilections
and prejudices are considered by
the library in his immediate neighborhood,
the display of his national flag and
the special stories told the children on the
fete day of his country. A people without
traditions is not a people, and if we
expect these strangers to respect our institutions,
we must show them an equal
courtesy.</p>

<p>This regard shown by the library and
other institutions for the national characteristics
of the parents reacts upon the
children and they grow to understand that
though their elders may have been outstripped
in the effort to become Americanized
they have behind them an historical
background which is respected by the
very Americans whose customs the children
ape so carefully.</p>

<p>The reading circle and the story hour
are similar in their purpose for they are
both intended to call the attention of the
children to special books and to open
up the delights of a new world to imaginations
often starved in squalor and poverty.
Both the reading aloud and the storytelling
have their rightful place in the
home and are merely grafted on the library
in its attempt to supply its share
of the "illusory home" for which we are
striving.</p>

<p>If the Sunday story-tellings and clubs
meet the neighborhood needs more efficiently
as Miss Smith has suggested, the
library schedule should be so arranged as
to accommodate them.</p>

<p>The time of childhood is a time of unbounded
curiosities. Everything is new
and wonderful and open to investigation,
and that library may count itself blessed
of the gods which can command the co-operation
of a good museum. Given an
exhibit case containing a few interesting
specimens, a placard bearing a brief description
of the specimens, and the titles
of a few books on the subject obtainable
at the library, and we can all of us picture
a rosy dream of budding scientists,
nature-lovers, and historians.</p>

<p>This child-like interest is the secret of
the popularity of the moving-picture show.
Here we see unfolded the processes of
nature, the opening of a flower, the life
of a bee, we ride in a runaway train and
in an aeroplane, and we see enacted the
daily human drama of love and hate. Here
is an opportunity which many libraries
have grasped, and slides are furnished the
picture theaters announcing the location
of the library and bearing some such legend
as this: "Your Free Public Library
has arranged with this management to
select interesting books and magazine articles
upon the historical, literary, and industrial
subjects treated in these pictures.
It is a bright idea to see something good
and then learn more about it." Mr. Percy
Mackaye in his recent book on the Civic
Theater, comments on this as follows:
"A brighter idea&mdash;may we not add?&mdash;if the
founders of the library had recognized
the dynamic appeal of a moving-picture
house, and endowed it to the higher uses of
civic art! Truly, a spectacle, humorous
but pathetic: Philanthropy in raiment of
marble, humbly beseeching patronage from
the tattered Muse of the people!"</p>

<p>So far as the writer knows, but one library
has as yet made moving pictures
a permanent addition to its activities, al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>though
a small town in Washington State
has intimated that it would do so, provided
the Carnegie Trust Fund would
give it money. It is a sign of the times,
and one of which note must be taken, for
it gives the library a chance to deepen
the benefit of such good pictures as there
are and to raise the standard of the others.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the interest of many boys
and girls is forced prematurely to the subject
of how they may aid in the family
support. They leave school untrained and
unfitted for the life they have to live, and
go into shops, factories, department stores,
and other service. Whether they leave
because of economic pressure or because
of a lack of interest in their school work
the fact remains that 32 per cent of the
children entering school drop out before
they reach the sixth grade, and only 8 per
cent finish the fourth year of high school.
Manual training and vocational guidance
are taking a hand in the matter and the
part of the library is evident, not only in
its supply of books on these topics but in
the personal interest of the library assistants
and in their suggestions and advice to
the young folks who are struggling to find
themselves. This is of course but a drop
in the bucket but it is an effort in the right
direction.</p>

<p>So many of these young people leaving
school prematurely are shut up at the
crucial age of adolescence in huge factories
and stores, creeping home at night too
tired to move unnecessarily, or letting
the individuality which has been so sternly
repressed all day burst forth in excesses
and indiscretions. Only a few will come
to the library, so to make sure the library
must go to them.</p>

<p>One of the most notable examples of this
kind of work is in the main plant of Sears,
Roebuck &amp; Co. in Chicago. The company
furnishes room, heat, light, and librarian's
salary and the public library
provides the books. This type of library
may combine the intimate personal relationships
of the small branch, the club, the
story hour, and the vocational bureau. It
may, as the Sears, Roebuck library has
done, publish lists of books covering certain
grades of a school course in grammar,
rhetoric, history of literature, and
study of the classics, and through the
personal influence of the librarian it may
make these courses really used, for always
in work of this kind it is the personal
equation that counts.</p>

<p>Some commercial houses have independent
libraries of their own, sometimes in
connection with their service department,
as does the Joseph &amp; Feiss Co. of Cleveland,
in which case the direction of the
library comes under the charge of a person
whose duty it is to use every means
to deepen, strengthen, and broaden the
capacity of every employe so that he may
remain an individual and not become a machine.
This is an age of industrialism
which has early placed upon the boys and
girls the responsibilities of life, and the
love of books is one of the most important
of the influences which will keep the pendulum
from swinging too far upon the side
of materialism and purely commercial ambition.</p>

<p>These are some of the ways in which the
library is trying to meet the changing
conditions of child life in the city through
the children's rooms, the homes, the
schools, the playgrounds, the factories, and
other institutions which have to do with
the employment, amusement, or education
of children.</p>

<p>From many of these problems the life
of the country child is mercifully free,
but in place of them there is the isolation
of farm life and the idleness on the part
of the children so often found in country
villages. As more than half of our population
is in the country, it is but logical
that libraries should long ago have made
some attempt to reach a class of readers
who, as Mr. Dewey says, "have a larger
margin of leisure, fewer distractions, and
fewer opportunities to get the best reading.
They read more slowly and carefully
and get more good from books than
their high-pressure city cousins whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
crowded lives leave little time for intellectual
digestion."</p>

<p>Long before the formation of the Country
Life Commission, librarians were sending
traveling libraries to farm-houses and
rural communities, and library commissions
are now scattering broadcast the
opportunities for reading which will do
so much to "effectualize rural society."
When we think of books and the country,
we think also of Hagerstown and the
book wagon, an institution which in its
influence on country life may well be added
to the famous trilogy of "rural free delivery,
rural telephones, and Butterick patterns."
Greater attention is being paid
in these days to conditions of country life,
both on farms and in villages, and the
work of the country librarian is as broad
and as interesting as that of her city co-worker.</p>

<p>But whether the work is done in the city
or the country, in a crowded tenement district
or on a thousand-acre ranch, it has
as its foundation the same underlying
principle: that of co-operation with all other
available agencies to the end that the
boys and girls may have a fuller opportunity
to become good citizens. We cannot
be progressive if we are not plastic,
and in the adaptation of our work to the
changing conditions of child life lies the
secret of the value of the children's library.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: We give a sigh of
satisfaction and one of regret: satisfaction
over the pleasure we have had in listening
to these fine, moving chapters; regret that
they have been so brief. We are reconciled
only by the fact that there are two
fine companion volumes still to come. Mr.
WILLIS H. KERR, of the Kansas State
Normal School, will give us the first one,
the subject being:</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>NORMAL SCHOOLS AND THEIR RELATION
TO LIBRARIANSHIP</h2>


<p>That there is a close relation between
librarianship and the forces of education
is implied both in the special topic of this
paper and in the general theme of the
morning: "Children and young people;
their conditions at home, in the school,
and in the library." Indeed librarian and
teacher have more in common than we
yet think. For real library work is teaching,
and real teaching is guidance in living,
and to live well for thy neighbor and
thyself is&mdash;real library work.</p>

<p>The burden of this discussion will be,
not whether the library is an integral part
of education, but rather what modern education,
as an art, science, and practice, has
to say about the attitude and method and
practice of library work. With open mind
and modest, may we attempt a statement
of "library pedagogy" to parallel current
educational practice? How may we librarians
knit our work more effectively
into the educational fabric? How best correlate
people and books?</p>

<p>If such a statement of library pedagogy
is possible, even though tentative, it is
worth our while. From college days there
rings in my ears the topic of an address
by Dr. Samuel B. McCormick, now President
of the University of Pittsburgh: "We
can achieve that which we can intelligently
conceive and adequately express."
We must see our whole job through and
through if we are to cope with our friends
who do not yet see what we are at. The
good brother, a Ph. D. of one of our best
universities, a successful city school superintendent,
now a fellow professor, who
said, "I can see how instruction of our normal
school students in library methods
will help them in their work here, but how
will it help them as teachers? Anyone
can find a book in a school library." The
superintendent who complained that all
his pupils got at the public library was
sore eyes and ruined minds from reading
trashy fiction; the library trustee who
likened library work and salary to dry-goods
counter service and wage; the typewriter
salesman who objected to open
shelves and book wagons and story hours,
because they cost&mdash;I won't say how much
he said; what infinite patience, what skillful
teaching power must we librarians
have, to turn this tide and use it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>Lest we paint the picture too darkly, let
it be said with all thankfulness and cheer
that multitudes of teachers, superintendents,
boys, girls, men and women, do understand.
There is Superintendent Condon,
formerly of Providence, now of Cincinnati,
of whom Mr. Foster says in the
last (1912) Providence report: "Mr. Condon's
co-operation with the library was
constant, intelligent, and effective." There
is Mary Antin and her brothers and sisters,
Americans all, to whom one of the richest
gifts of the "Promised Land" is the public
library. There is State Superintendent Alderman,
of Oregon, and Mrs. Alderman.
There is the United States Commissioner
of Education, Mr. Claxton, and Mrs. Claxton.
In every state are men like a western
Kansas superintendent (way out next to
Colorado, on the prairies), who found his
community destitute of books; even school
books and tablets had to be ordered by the
drug store from a distant city; no community
interest, no debating societies, no
class plays, no school athletic teams. He
made school vital to the boys and girls.
Then because to his thinking education
does not end with school days, and because
he had the library vision, before he was
there a year he passed the subscription
paper, organized the library association,
got the books and magazines, and opened
the public library. He gave that town
something to live for. And every state has
librarians like the little Kansas lady in a
country community who does reference
work and draws patrons from sixteen surrounding
school districts by the use of the
rural telephone.</p>

<p>What have the normal schools to do
with all this? Before answering this question,
it may be well to note that the term
"normal school" has not always the same
significance. In the United States there
are 194 public normal schools. Scholastic
standards are of three general types:
First, the old-time normal school, whose
graduates have little more than completed
a high school course including some required
pedagogy. Second, the largest division,
the two-year normal school, which
requires two years of college cultural and
professional work, high school graduation
being required for entrance. Third, the
normal college or state teachers' college,
which grants the bachelor's degree for the
completion of four years of college cultural
and professional work. As a rule the
graduates of the high school normal course
go into the rural or the small-town
schools; the graduates of the two-year college
course, into elementary schools and
special subjects; and the graduates of the
four-year college course, into high school
subjects, principalships, and superintendencies.
The four-year state teachers' colleges
of the United States can be counted
on the ten fingers, and their ultimate
sphere of influence is being debated. It
would seem, however, that the adequate
teacher-training institution must be as
broad in its facilities and standards as are
the conditions of modern life with which
teachers must cope.</p>

<p>In the normal schools of these three
types, student attendance varies from 100
to nearly 3,000, the average being about
600. Faculties vary from 8 or 10 members
to 125. Equipment varies correspondingly,
the better schools having very complete
facilities. For example, the Eastern Illinois
State Normal School, at Charleston,
which is said to have a faculty ranking in
scholarship with the universities, has 1,200
students, 31 members of faculty, offers two
college years of teacher-training, has three
buildings, a library of 16,000 volumes, and
like many other normal schools of its type
has an assured future and a fine field of
influence. You will pardon another example,
I hope, cited because I can be still
more definite in describing it: The Kansas
State Normal School, at Emporia, is
a type of the four-year normal college. It
was established in 1865. Last year it had
2,750 students, 350 in the training school
(comprising kindergarten and grades one
to eight), 1,100 in the normal high school,
and 1,300 in the college. It had a faculty
of 100, nearly half of these being men,
many of the best universities being represented.
It has 11 buildings, including an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
enormous gymnasium, a library, a hospital,
a training school, science building, etc. It
has a department of library science, in
charge of a professor giving full time to
that department, and on the same plane as
other departments of instruction. Of this
same general type, in equipment, numbers,
and standards, are the schools at Ypsilanti,
Michigan; Cedar Falls, Iowa; Kirksville,
Missouri; Greeley, Colorado; Terre Haute,
Indiana;&mdash;I do not mean to slight other
worthy examples.</p>

<p>Aside from these three types of public
normal schools, another important type of
teacher-training organization is the department
of education and psychology in our
best colleges and universities, exemplified
notably by the School of Education of the
University of Chicago, and Teachers' College
of Columbia University, the last-named
being perhaps the most efficient
teachers' college in the world. I hasten
to add mention of the conspicuously helpful
work in educational psychology, pure
and applied, which is being done at Clark
University, Massachusetts, under the inspiring
leadership of Dr. G. Stanley Hall.</p>

<p>Now, using the term "normal schools"
to include all of these types of institutions
and as representing their practices and
ideals, may we ask the question we left
a moment ago, "What have the normal
schools to do with librarianship?" This:
The normal schools have now consciously
taken up the task of preparing teachers
who understand the life that now is and
can teach boys and girls to live that life
and to be useful members of society here
and hereafter. These organized institutions
of teacher-training take themselves
seriously, they accept the responsibility of
their task, and they are measurably succeeding;
despite the declarations of popular
magazines and investigating committees
that our schools are a colossal failure.
Which they are not, for didn't they train
Mary Antin, and Miss Stearns, and you
and me? If librarianship is educational
work, and it is, the normal schools may
therefore have some suggestion of educational
practice worthy the consideration
of librarians.</p>

<p>What is the educational world thinking
and doing? Examine the program of the
National Education Association, to meet
week after next at Salt Lake City. I group
some of the topics from the general sessions:
<b>First</b>, What is education?; Education
for freedom; The personal element in
our educational problems; Teaching, and
testing the teaching of essentials; Measuring
results. <b>Second</b>, What shall we do
with the single-room school?; The rural
school; Fundamental reorganizations demanded
by the rural life problem; Rural
betterments; The schoolhouse evening
center. <b>Third</b>, moral values in pupil self-government,
The high school period as a
testing time, Public schools and public
health.</p>

<p>Relate these groups of topics with this
definition of education from the late Andrew
S. Draper, of honored memory:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Education that has life and enters into
life; education that makes a living and
makes life worth living; education that
can use English to express itself; education
that does not assume that a doctor
must be an educated man and that a mechanic
or a farmer cannot be; education
that appeals to the masses, that makes better
citizens and a greater state; education
that supports the imperial position of
the State and inspires education in all of
the States&mdash;that is the education that concerns
New York."</p></div>

<p>Mingle with educational men and women,
search the educational periodicals and
programs, scan the educational books, visit
the normal colleges; and I think you will
discover that something like this is happening
in the educational world: The content
of education is being adapted to meet
the needs of all the classes and the masses.
The method of education is being adapted
to the individual. The result is that education
is being universalized, socialized,
democratized.</p>

<p>In this adaptation of educational material
and method, all eyes are upon the individual
child. We are studying this child,
working for him. We are playing for the
batter, tackling the man with the ball. We
believe it is more important to develop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the undiscovered resource than to run all
boys and all girls through the same hopper.
A phrase used in the <b>School Arts
Magazine</b> for May, 1913, in describing a
notable Boston exhibit of art illustration,
breathes this spirit: "Instruction in illustration,
should be creative and individual
from the outset. Models are posed to
help in expressing more truthfully the conception
of the illustrator rather than as a
discipline in abstract drawing."</p>

<p>The true teacher never gives up a boy or
a girl. But mind you, we are saving the
individual, making a man out of him, not
that he may be a self-centered unsocial
phenomenon, but that he may be a fellow
among men, a useful social unit. We want
strong individuality willing and able to
live in society.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest word in current education
is motivation. That word motivation
covers a multitude of sins and a
multitude of virtues. Motivation does not
mean coddling. It does not mean allowing
the child to do as he pleases. On the
other hand, motivation does not mean
forcing an unnatural process or situation
upon a helpless child or a helpless public.
It does not mean that we are to give something
to the child. Motivation is not
didactic in attitude.</p>

<p>The spring of action in all of us is impulse.
There is no time here to go into
the psychology of instinct, impulse, emotion,
motive, action, and all that. Suffice
it for example that through the play instinct
and impulse the wise teacher leads
the child to a respect for fair-play, order,
law, justice. The child never knows
where he got it, but he has what he needed,
and he has it indelibly. This process
assumes a God-given wisdom on the part
of the teacher: to know how that little
mind is working, what it needs, how it
may be brought to feel the need, and then
to lead, draw out, educate that mind&mdash;O,
miracle of miracles!</p>

<p>A step further in the consideration
of the educational process: Perhaps
there have been committed more atrocities,
more crimes in the name of
education, in the high school than in any
other period of school life. More fairly
stated, the crimes have been in the upper
six years of the usual twelve,&mdash;in that period
which is called adolescence. Why
do so many boys and girls drop out of the
upper grades? Why do so many youths
never complete high school? The vocational
training people have one answer,
and it consists in letting the boy work at
something of which he feels the need.
They motivate his work. The boy from
the farm can't read Tennyson's "Princess;"
set him at the <b>Breeder's Gazette</b>
or the testing of seed-corn; you can teach
him English as readily through one task
as the other. Only that boy never would
learn English from "The Princess,"&mdash;and
I love Tennyson.</p>

<p>As an example of skillful motivation in
teaching may I describe a case which is
also an object-lesson to librarians in correlating
people and books? It is a third-year
high school class in argumentation.
After some preliminary study, one day
the teacher remarks rather inconsequentially,
"Do you know I believe the 'Boston
tea party' was an unjustifiable destruction
of property, and that unprejudiced historians
now admit it?" Now that won't
"go" in Kansas any easier than it will
in Massachusetts. Teacher is immediately
challenged, and she replies, "Well, I'll
debate it with you; and I'll be fair and
square with you and tell you of some material
on your side. But there is one man
whose authority I would not want to dispute;
you'll surely treat me fairly, won't
you?" A young lady member of the class
at once puts a motion to the class that
it will not be considered fair to use the
writings of Edmund Burke against teacher.
Does that class depend upon bluffing
its way through that debate with teacher?
No, it keeps us busy at the library to get
material out fast enough, even though we
had been previously informed by the teacher
that the material would be wanted.
Even Dr. Johnson's "Taxation no tyranny"
is read with eagerness. Teacher finally
agrees to debate even against Burke. Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Burke a bore to that class? Why, the library
has to buy additional copies. Of
course, the end desired by the teacher all
the time was Burke.</p>

<p>More and more, in the instruction of
adolescent and adult, the teacher's effort
is being directed toward arousing a problem
to be solved. Whether by a class lecture,
by a class discussion, or by a personal
conference, the pupil is brought to
feel that it is important for him to find the
answer. Is it not important, then, for the
librarian to be skilled in drawing out a
statement of the problem, or, changing the
figure, to recognize accurately the symptoms
and to prescribe unerringly? I think
librarians having to do with high school
and college students should rather frequently
visit classes and attend lectures.
If this were done, the pupil would less often
be ground between upper and nether
millstone, and the millstones would think
more of each other.</p>

<p>Thus far, educational ideals and practices.
Now will they help us any in attempting
to formulate a library pedagogy?
I believe they will. I believe that the
teaching attitude, the study of the individual,
the putting of the individual's
needs far and away before the observance
of inflexible rule and practice, and the determination
to correlate people and books
and life to the very ends of the earth,&mdash;these
four stones at least will be in the
foundation of library pedagogy.</p>

<p>I am not sure that all educational people
will agree entirely with the foregoing
statement of educational principles and
methods. I am quite sure that I may as
well gracefully hand my head now to some
of you because of the following library corollaries
of the preceding educational doctrines.
Some of these are my own beliefs,
some are beliefs of educational men regarding
libraries:</p>

<p>In the training of librarians, would it
be more in accord with modern pedagogy
to have less lecturing, less practice work
done in the this-is-the-only-way-to-do-it attitude,
and to have more of the come-on-and-let's-find-out,
the learn-by-doing laboratory
spirit?</p>

<p>Educational administration is being remodeled,
centralized. If library work is to
be more and more educational, school men
have said to me, why not make the public
library an integral part of the city school
system, and the state library and state library
commission an arm of the state department
of education? It is a terrible
thought, but it will not drown by denying
it.</p>

<p>When library work becomes educational
through and through, and all library assistants
are experts in psychology and human
nature, the fines system will be a
thing of the past.</p>

<p>Conservation of the individual means
that it is better to have a book in use than
to have it lying peacefully on the shelf
entirely surrounded by unbroken rules.</p>

<p>Conservation of society means that it
is better to have the library open on holidays
and Sundays, when the working man
isn't "dead tired," than to report an increased
circulation of fiction.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: For an object lesson
as to the strenuous life we go to Oyster
Bay. For library buildings we go to East
Ninety-first street, New York, or when he
is in Europe we go to Skibo Castle. For
information as to the latest inventions we
go to the laboratory of Mr. Edison. For
full information as to the best in high
school work we go to the Girls' High
School in Brooklyn. Miss MARY E. HALL.</p>

<p>Miss Hall spoke extemporaneously upon
the enlarging scope of library work in
high schools. Some of the points discussed
were treated by her in a paper before the
section on Library Work with Children at
the Ottawa conference, 1912. See Ottawa
Proceedings in Bulletin of the American
Library Association, v. 6, p. 260-68.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: As my eye roves over
this audience I see it is thickly sprinkled
with punctuation marks. It has been suggested
that some of our papers ought to
be discussed from the floor. We shall be
glad to hear from any librarians who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
in this audience, either in the form of experiences
or comment.</p>

<p>Mr. OLIN S. DAVIS: While I approve
fully all that the last speaker has said, I
feel very strongly that the college or high
school library should not be too complete
and that the student should be encouraged
to use the public library. Work should be
given to the students in high schools and
girls' schools that would require their coming
to the public library, because if the
children in the grades and high schools do
not learn to use the public library in those
years they will not be apt to use the
library in later years when they have left
school.</p>

<p>Miss HALL: I would like to say that
the first thing we do with pupils is to take
a census of the entering class to find out
how many do not have cards in the public
library; interview them to see why they
have not; even to write letters to the parents
and urge them to allow their children
to have cards; and to see before the
end of the first term that every student in
the entering class has a card in the public
library, has a note of introduction from
the school librarian to the branch librarian
of the public library, and to see that the
branch librarian of our big cities and the
high school librarian work together four
years with that student. We have the
very closest co-operation.</p>

<p>Miss AHERN: Most of you reading
library literature lately have seen considerable
criticism of the fact that when students
go out from college they do not
know how to use the library. That is
sometimes the student's fault, but most
often it is the fault of the college curriculum.
That is a topic we need not discuss
here. But I believe librarians will do a
great service to those who are going into
college activities if they emphasize and
elaborate that idea of putting into the requirements
for college entrance, a knowledge
of how to use library machinery.</p>

<p>There are a good many things that are
necessary for students to know before they
are able to take up the work in colleges,
particularly in literature and language. I
am not saying that these should be any
less. But here is something that I wonder
no one has ever thought of before.
It means a good deal more to a student to
know how to use the various reference
books in the college library on, say, the
works of John Milton, than to have read
some of the things which are included in
the entrance examination. I think the idea
of requiring a knowledge of how to use
the library for college entrance is the best
thing I have heard at a library meeting for
a long time, and I hope the librarians who
are present will impress that idea on their
superintendents of schools, on their high
school principals, and on the college authorities,
as far as they can. It is a good
thing. If we should not get anything else
out of this 1913 meeting but to impress on
the school people that a knowledge of how
to use the library is a necessary requirement
for a college course, we shall have
gained a great point.</p>

<p>Mr. RANCK: I should like to ask Miss
Hall about her experience with reference
to the use of the library on the teaching
of English and literature in the high
school.</p>

<p>Miss HALL: I have been very much interested
in this. Our school has been so
large it has been very difficult to do all we
would like to do. We have not been able
to do what has been done in the Detroit or
Grand Rapids high school in the way of instruction.
But I have been interested in
seeing what it has done for the English
and the history departments. In the first
place, our teachers are coming with their
classes for instruction and the teachers
are learning a great many things which
they are putting in practice. For the last
year we have done more with the Reader's
Guide in history than ever before. Teachers
are assigned to help me in my work.
After they heard the talk on the Reader's
Guide they said, "We can do this: we will
go through the Reader's Guide and we will
bring out everything that is really interesting
on the history of France, Germany,
China, Russia and the Balkan War; we will
look over those articles and make a card<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
of the best things." They are using the
Reader's Guide in English more than ever
before; they are using reference books
more. After the talk on the Statesmen's
Yearbook and on the almanacs and some
of the yearbooks, such as the New International
Yearbook, they are using them
almost as textbooks. The Statesmen's
Yearbook is in use nearly all the time, as
is the New International Yearbook, since
that talk. They are using the Reader's
Guide for new material&mdash;essays that they
want on special subjects, and are using it
for debate work, informal debates on all
sorts of interesting current problems for
English work, training the students to do
oral debating without any notes, and talks
on the topics of the day. They are using
encyclopedias more wisely than they used
to. Teachers used to send scholars to encyclopedias
for everything. And when we
talked about the real use of encyclopedias
and bibliographies, how the encyclopedia
simply gave you a certain amount of
definite information and often led to more
important things, they began using those
bibliographies.</p>

<p>Miss HOBART: I do not know that any
librarian has been trying to work out the
problem which I have of reaching the public
school pupils and teachers. Some of
the best things that I have found in that
way are these: I made myself familiar, as
early in the term as possible, with the
teachers and the conditions of their home
life. I found that some had very poor
places to room, as they are apt to have in
small communities, and to those I offered
the use of the library rooms for evening
use and for time out of school when they
wished to correct papers. Our library is
warm and light in the winter and cool and
light in the summer. And the teachers
were extremely glad to have a place where
they could come and be quiet and comfortable
and do their own work. I think
that last year the teachers in our small village
practically lived in the library. Even
those who had homes there used to make
it their abiding place most of their waking
hours. For the high school pupils, at the
time of their graduating essays, we laid
books aside in different places in the
library. Many of those children had no
proper places at home where they could
write. They came to the library and did
their work; almost all the work on their
graduating essays was done evenings. For
six weeks we gave the use of our catalog
rooms to two girls who had their books
sent there. There were several out-of-town
children; to those we gave a room in the
basement. They came from school as
quickly as possible at noon, ate their
luncheon in a very short time and spent
the rest of the intermission in the library
doing reference work. The expressions of
appreciation we have received and the consciousness
of the help given to those children
in the use of the library has been a
great source of satisfaction.</p>

<h2>FIFTH GENERAL SESSION</h2>


<p class="center">(Friday morning, June 27, 1913.)</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: We begin this morning
the fifth session of this conference and
the theme covering the papers is, "The
library's service to business and legislation."
Ten years ago it would not have
occurred to anyone perhaps that it would
be possible to have a series of papers upon
this subject, and the surprising expansion
of the service in these directions is evidenced
by the fact that we have, in order at
all to attempt to cover this subject adequately,
a larger number of papers on this
morning's program than we have on the
program for any other of the subjects
which have been scheduled. I will ask Mr.
C. B. LESTER to start the program with
his paper upon</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>THE PRESENT STATUS OF LEGISLATIVE
REFERENCE WORK</h2>


<p>It is now more than twenty years since
the need of specialization in the library's
work on subjects of legislation was recognized
in New York in the creation of a
special staff for such work, and it is just
about ten years since the successful combination
in Wisconsin of such special ref<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>erence
work with the formulation of bills
aroused most of the states to the possibilities
of usefulness in this field. It would
therefore seem worth while to examine
the work so far done to discover if possible
such principles and tendencies as
may be subject to generalization.</p>

<p>It is at once obvious that any such generalization
in a broad sense must be difficult,
for this present year shows in legislation
both east and west that we have not
yet come to rest on such fundamental principles
as to method even though there may
be substantial unanimity as to policy. The
new laws in Vermont (and I think in New
Hampshire) in the east&mdash;in Ohio, Indiana,
and Illinois in the middle west&mdash;and in
California on the Pacific coast show such
differences that it is evident that local conditions
must still be very largely controlling.
And to go back a full year or more
would bring to notice the new work organized
in several states through university
bureaus but without special legislation,
and the proposals before the Congress.</p>

<p>Comparatively little examination shows
that the conception of the work to be done
differs widely. Mr. Kaiser of the University
of Illinois, who is preparing a detailed
study of the subject, writes me: "I find
that in practically thirty-two states it is
attempted in some form or other&mdash;the
state library as a whole, a division of the
state library created within the library, a
division created by law, a separate bureau,
library commission bureaus, state university
bureaus, etc." Obviously this must include
practically all states where the state
library is other than a law library only or
a historical collection only, and must credit
with doing legislative reference work
those states where general reference work
is done on subjects of legislation. But
there is a more exact use of the term
which takes account of the fundamental
principle well suggested in the statement
of the Librarian of Congress in his communication
to Congress in 1911. "A legislative
reference bureau goes further [than
the Division of Bibliography]. It undertakes
not merely to classify and to catalog,
but to draw off from a general collection
the literature, that is the data, bearing
upon a particular legislative project. It
indexes, extracts, compiles." It breaks up
existing forms in which information is contained
and classifies the resulting parts,
and often "adds to printed literature written
memoranda as to facts and even opinions
as to merit."</p>

<p>Such work as the legislative reference
staff should be qualified to do is distinctly
informational rather than educational in
its reference to the patron. It does the
work of research, of gathering, sorting and
uniting the scattered fact material wanted
and presents the results ready for use. And
to be fully effective this work must in
some way be co-ordinated with the formulation
of legislation, so that the product offered
by the legislator may be both firmly
founded and properly constructed. This
work is so evidently necessary that it will
be done in an increasing number of states
whether the state library or some other
agency undertakes it and protects its efficiency
by the impartial, non-political and
permanent organization of it which can be
there best provided.</p>

<p>Practically all legislation specifically
providing for such work has been passed
in the years beginning 1907 and it is significant
that most of this emphasizes research
and drafting. The laws specially
providing for such work are as follows:</p>


<ul><li>Alabama, 1907, no. 255.</li>
<li>California, 1913.</li>
<li>Illinois, 1913.</li>
<li>Indiana, 1913, ch. 255 (1907, ch. 147).</li>
<li>Michigan, 1907, ch. 306 (1913, ch. 144).</li>
<li>Missouri, Stat., 1909, Sec. 8177.</li>
<li>Montana, 1909, ch. 65.</li>
<li>Nebraska, 1911, ch. 72.</li>
<li>North Dakota, 1909, ch. 157 (1907, ch. 243).</li>
<li>Ohio, 1913 (1910, no. 384).</li>
<li>Pennsylvania, 1909, no. 143 (1913).</li>
<li>Rhode Island, 1907, ch. 1471.</li>
<li>South Dakota, 1907, ch. 185.</li>
<li>Texas, 1909, ch. 70.</li>
<li>Vermont, 1912, ch. 14 (1910, ch. 9).</li>
<li>Wisconsin, Stat. Sec. 373 f.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>An analysis of the work done, whether
provided for by legislation or by administrative
practice, shows certain other
facts. The number of the staff in any state
is often variable, temporary or part time
assistance is often used, and this is true
where this work is not a part of the work
of a state library or other wider organization.
Furthermore, the cost in money is
almost impossible to estimate accurately
in many places, because of this co-operation
with other work. In starting a new
work this difficulty in answering the question
of what it costs elsewhere must be
faced. The best way to meet it seems to
be to make the comparison on the basis
of the work wanted, definitely planning
what is to be done, and asking for a lump
sum to cover its estimated cost.</p>

<p>The drafting proposition is a most important
element. Some three or four states
already have official bill-drafting agencies,
other than legislative reference departments,
and a number of others definitely
depend upon the attorney-general's office
for this work. In some states there is opposition
to putting this in the hands of a
non-legislative agency, and in others the
libraries, while ready to handle a specialized
reference work, are not ready to undertake
drafting. Obviously this work requires
highly specialized training, and
equally, I believe, it will be agreed that
this service should be rendered and that
it must be in the closest co-operation with
the reference work. There is no doubt in
my own mind that the best condition is
that of a single agency to perform this
dual work, where the establishment of
such is possible, and the usual organization
seems to include both the expert draftsmen
and the special clerical and stenographic
assistance.</p>

<p>This service in the primary formulation
of bills must inevitably lead to a similar
assistance as bills progress toward final
enactment. This care as to form through
the processes of amendment and revision
will ultimately be complete if the enacted
statute law is what it should be "to stand
the test."</p>

<p>This leads me to certain suggestions of
other fields of service in the legislative
process which should all tend to better the
whole legislative product. Of course, in
much of this service the emphasis is
placed upon form and make-up of the final
product, the discretion as to subject matter
resting elsewhere, but that discretionary
judgment is to be based upon the most
complete information it is possible to furnish.
Most of these services are now performed
by the libraries or other non-legislative
agencies in some states, but of
course not all, or indeed many, in any one
state. They include editing, foot-noting,
side-noting, indexing of session laws, and
the preparation of tables of amendments,
repeals and similar matter; the proper filing
and care of original bills, journals,
committee records, and similar matter,
after the work of the session is completed;
the editing and indexing of the
printed journal; editorial work of various
forms upon the legislative documents.
These are all services needed by our
states, useful to the legislative bodies, and
only properly handled through some permanent
agency. Is the state library that
agency? I leave the question for your consideration,
and suggest that some uncertainty
at present as to just what may be
most desirable is evident particularly in
the new legislation in Vermont, Ohio, Indiana
and California. It has already been
brought out in prepared paper and in discussion
at this conference that the state
library should not be a central public library
in its content or its method. It is
rather possible to express the field of its
activities as that of a collection of special
libraries. Into that field would come quite
naturally the varied services to the legislative
branch of the government which have
been suggested. As already stated some
of them are now supplied in some states.
What we shall ultimately work toward in
our states is a complete organization of
these allied branches of work, all of which
focus about the work of the legislature.
Some of these services are at once recognized
as within the field of the library&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>about
others there is a decided difference
of opinion. But they all have many common
elements, many points of contact.
They are most effectively to be handled
as a group. The tendency will surely be
toward a concentration rather than a scattering
of these parts of one general work.
Plans for such a concentration, adapted to
a particular set of conditions, to be sure,
have already been put into concrete bill
form in New York and the bill was before
the legislature this year. The question
presents many new features, but is not
something to be answered perhaps in the
distant future; it is rather, I believe,
worthy of a very real consideration in the
present.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: The second paper
this morning, which follows very logically
after the one which we have just heard,
will be by Mr. DEMARCHUS C. BROWN,
state librarian of Indiana, on</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>STATE-WIDE INFLUENCE OF THE
STATE LIBRARY</h2>


<p>The writer of this paper would be more
than Prot&aelig;an if he could say anything new
on this topic. All our associations, at least
the half dozen I belong to, meet so often
that repetition is forced upon us. In the
interim very few experiences or ideas
worth recording come to us. Biennial or
triennial sessions would lead to better
results and save money.</p>

<p>The personality and attainments of the
librarian (and his staff) are of prime importance
in making the state library a
dominating influence in the commonwealth.
He is the man behind the gun.
I put him first. From the negative side,&mdash;his
position should not be subject to partisan
or personal influence. That is a
blight to start with and will ruin any
institution. We are still afflicted with that
curse in places, not only in the state libraries
but in official positions generally.</p>

<p>Affirmatively, the head of the state library
ought to be a person of scholarly
acquirements or at least in deep and appreciative
sympathy with scholarship and
knowledge. If he is a scholar in a limited
field he should be in accord with all
who are trained in other departments.
He should be able to represent the state
in its educational and scientific undertakings,
by papers and addresses, whenever
called upon. It goes without saying that
he should be a trained man in educational
or library or literary work and of course
an executive officer. His library is a laboratory
of all for all in the state and he
must be in touch with the work of that
laboratory. His library is the distributer
of blessings to a great commonwealth, and
according to the motto of the "Library
Company" of Philadelphia, that is divine
(Communiter bona profundere deum est).
I'll not quote the Latin&mdash;it would be classic,
and to be classic is against the regulations
of the Zeitgeist. I want him to be an
inspirer for all to love art and poetry, and
study and history and politics (real); and
not merely skilled in the knowledge of
card indexes and catalog rules. A certain
famous general in the Confederate Army
spent so much of his time on details of
drill and quartermaster's regulations that
he forgot how to fight his army.</p>

<p>I have put the librarian first in this
broadening influence of the state library.
All the volumes and equipment and staff
will be comparatively a failure without
this scholarly, well-trained, wide-awake
executive officer.</p>

<p>As to the various ways in which the
state library can extend its influence and
make itself useful, permit me to suggest a
few. This institution can well be the bibliographical
center of the state. Every
club, school, library, society, and all citizens
can be made to know that here information
can be obtained about books.</p>

<p>Our own demand is quite large and
ought to be larger. There are libraries
with meagre equipment, schools with
none, people with none, colleges with little&mdash;all
these may be taught to turn to the
central institution for bibliographical information.
I consider this a source of
wide-spreading influence, valuable and
helpful to the whole state. I have placed
it second more because I deem it impor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>tant,
not because I think all of these
points can be listed accurately as to their
relative positions.</p>

<p>Our states heretofore have been very
slow in preserving their history, both of
the commonwealth and municipalities.
This has led, perchance, to the unspeakable
commercial county histories with
their unspeakable portraits and unspeakable
cost, which we are compelled to purchase
in order to have something.</p>

<p>The state library's influence should extend
over the entire state in an attempt
to teach the preservation of history. The
library is the natural place for the collection
and organization of the history of
the state. The archives may well be kept
here for reference and use, though some
states have a separate archives and history
department.</p>

<p>I wish we knew how to preserve history.
We don't keep or build memorials, we tear
down and throw away. What we want is
the new, the fresh, the raw. The old, the
seasoned, the ripe, we think is effete (how
we like that word in referring to the old
advanced civilization of Europe). The state
library has a great, unploughed field to
cultivate. Personally, I find people ready
to burn up newspapers or manuscripts, or
sell volumes for junk rather than give them
to an institution where they may be preserved.
I am trying to teach them otherwise,
but succeeding very slowly indeed.
I trust some of you are doing better.</p>

<p>The women's clubs are a source of help
in extending the influence of the library.
They are asking for information of all
kinds at all times. We laugh at them, I
know. They have papers on Shakespeare,
Goethe or Homer at one sitting and dispose
of them all. But what shall we do?
They are the conservers of culture and
reading. Men don't want them, i. e. culture
and reading. They are bourgeois,
"practical," (&agrave; bas with that word and up
with refinement and culture which is just
as meaningful in books as in a field where
we know culture is everything). I know
many prosperous country towns without a
men's reading organization or club in
them, but many women's. If the state library
in its state-wide influence, could convert
men to reading, it would do a great
work. Send your bulletin to the clubs, suggest
topics for discussion, and thus distribute
the leaven.</p>

<p>So much of our reading and study is
done through periodicals of every description
that it is made necessary for one central
institution to be well supplied with
these publications. The periodicals not
taken in the average library, college or
club, the foreign, like Revue de Deux
Mondes, and Dublin Review, for example,
and particularly the learned periodicals
used only occasionally, should be found in
the state library.</p>

<p>The state library can become a source
of information, widespread over the state,
by this process. Demands come sometimes
from remote corners, from a teacher or
some ambitious student, and he should
never be neglected. This department, I
fear, has been in a measure overlooked.
We have about a hundred from foreign
countries secured through exchange for
the Indiana Academy of Science. They
are not commonly called for but they form
a tie between the library and the scientific
men and students over the state.</p>

<p>By no means limit this list to scientific
periodicals. Make the selection as broad
as human interest, if funds and space permit.</p>

<p>It is commonplace to say that the state
library is the document depository of the
commonwealth. You know that now.
Many people do not realize it, however.
Every official publication of the state,
counties and municipalities, if preserved
here, will be a source for historical research
in the future. Nothing of the kind
should be thrown away. Many state libraries
were founded with this particular
purpose in view. The state library is the
logical place for the preservation of all
documents of the state. From it the municipal
authorities, students of state history
and political science, teachers, legislators
and citizens gather the information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
needed on the documentary history of the
state.</p>

<p>All the states have institutions of various
kinds&mdash;colleges, hospitals for insane,
the epileptic, the tubercular, reformatories,
etc., etc. Why should the state library
not at least supplement the small or large
collections in these institutions? Their
purpose is not to purchase books, though
some are needed. The state library's influence
and assistance should enter here,
also. Much can be done to enlarge the
views and inform the heads of these institutions
and to make happy many of the
inmates. No demand by a superintendent
of a state institution for books to be purchased
for and referred to by him would
be overlooked in the Indiana state library.
The institutions are scattered over
the state and the library's influence would
be spread in gathering material for the
people connected with these institutions.
The libraries of the state universities can
be supplemented to great advantage, as
has been done at least in our own state
and in yours, I have no doubt.</p>

<p>The newspapers of the state are not kept
with any regularity in the different localities.
They are a valuable fund of information
for the historian, who must sift rigidly
of course. Our attempt is to preserve
the papers from each county. We have
many instances already of the value of
our collection. We believe that a state-wide
service is done in this way. I know
the newspaper is not what we think it
ought to be, but certain conditions of politics,
business and social customs are pictures
which will otherwise be lost. The
librarian in the state library has imposed
upon him here an important duty to the
commonwealth, and the possibility of rendering
great service.</p>

<p>The high schools are fond of debating.
The boys are more easily aroused to reading
by the discussion of a public or social
problem. The local library is usually meagre.
If the school principal is kept in
close touch with the central library he
will know where to send for material. A
bulletin on "Debates" with bibliographical
lists is of great service to the school men.
The state library extends its work to educational
centers by this method. The Indiana
state library for several years has
followed this system and as a result has
almost been swamped with requests for
debate material. As many as forty high
schools in one week tried to overwhelm us,
but our staff stood the test womanfully
and won.</p>

<p>There are state-wide associations of all
kinds in every state. Many of them publish
reports or proceedings. The state librarian
may well keep his institution in
touch with all of these. The library may
even be a member of some of them, especially
educational, social, literary or artistic.
The presence of a member of its
staff at their meetings or correspondence
may lead to the use of the library by these
organizations in a way that will show that
the library is the thing to be used&mdash;a tool
for every man.</p>

<p>Common as it may be to say it, the assistance
to the blind of the state by the
central library must not be passed by. It
is a great joy for any one to note the
pleasure these unfortunate people obtain
from the collections from which they draw
daily. Very few, if any, are able to purchase
their own books. The number assisted
is small, but the benefit and happiness
are great and lasting.</p>

<p>As the state library is the document and
the political science center, it follows that
legislative and official information are to
be secured here. The officials and members
of the Assembly ought to be made
to know that the state library is, as it
were, the fountain head from which to
draw. If the library is worth anything or
its head and staff worth anything, they
should be consulted frequently by these
persons in their work of lawmaking. The
library has gathered and organized the
material and by means of its use by the
legislator, the library exerts a state-wide
service.</p>

<p>It is the province of the traveling libraries
department to lend collections of
books to groups of citizens in localities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
apart from libraries. This does not hinder
the state library from doing much for the
farmer individually and in farmers' institutes.
Addresses may be delivered, bibliographical
lists on agricultural subjects
sent and books loaned if the law permits
it, and I think it should.</p>

<p>In our own library we have letters and
requests from farmers; we preserve the
records of their institutes and granges.
One who had only half an hour a day to
read asked for a volume of Jefferson,
Shakespeare, or a good book on chiggers.
If he could find out how to get rid of the
chiggers, I would prefer that book to Jefferson,
whose apotheosis is sadly overworked.
That farmer's request was not
so fascinating as that of a teacher who
wanted a book on "the history of the human
people." This is a sample of Indiana
readers. Indiana, the home of authors!
(I want to express my opinion in
parenthesis here, that this Indiana literature
talk is also sadly overworked.)</p>

<p>All this concerns special classes of people
and books. But the general reader
must be looked after. If democratization
of books and reading is our keynote, and
I think it is, then the citizen who wants
to read on history, poetry, art, sociology,
religion, must not be neglected. State-wide
means much. It means an open mind
for all the demos.</p>

<p>Our central library shall not be a trade
shop, not for the bourgeoisie, but a mentor,
a guide, a place of refinement and culture.
Not for the practical man only&mdash;he
usually does not know anything and does
not want to; he has no breadth of view.
Looking up a trade item or a report or
some figures is good and useful; so is loving
a poet because it is at the foundation
of character and education.</p>

<p>We have recently been informed&mdash;no,
we have been told&mdash;that to talk about
reading, culture, the love of knowledge, is
"flapdoodle." A citizen may be benefited
by knowing how many miles of railroad
are in his county, or what amount
of money his city spends, but he will be
just as much benefited by reading a lofty
poem of Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier, Le Jeu de Paume
for example, or a stanza of William
Dwight Moody's, not that he will make
money, but something far better.</p>

<p>What I want to say is that the state
library shall extend the love of learning,
of literature, or art and all their kin to the
furthest boundaries of the state in order
that all may know that here is a fountain
whence all may receive instruction and
refreshment. Why should the business
man not read something besides the newspaper,
the statements of which are denied
the next day? Yet most men read nothing
else. If his own town library is small
let him call upon the state library and let
the state library be ready to help. I believe
that lending books must still be
granted to the state library. We have
calls from lovers of reading from every
corner of Indiana, from men who love culture,
knowledge and literature. These we
propose to accommodate as long as the
law permits. This observation is made
because it has been said repeatedly that
the state library shall deal in documents,
reports and reference books.</p>

<p>We have many foreigners in Indiana.
When these cannot secure what is wanted
at their local library I want them to come
to us, as recently happened when the Roumanians
wanted the text of their native
poets and something about their provincial
capital Nagygebin.</p>

<p>I trust that we may all have one great
library for reference with a minimum of
popular fiction&mdash;a library that is a guide
to scholarship and knowledge, a library
where every man who loves to read may
turn himself out to grass and browse,
browse deeply. Herein will we have state-wide
influence.</p>

<p>May I group these influences as a summary:&mdash;the
personality, fitness and scholarship
of the State Librarian; the bibliographical
center may well be the state
library; the legislative reference for the
Assembly and officials; the gathering and
preserving of the history and archives of
the state along with the encouragement
among the people to preserve local his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>torical
material; the collecting of newspapers
representing the entire commonwealth;
the creation of a periodical center
in the state library; close connection with
schools, colleges and all kinds of organizations,
social, literary, commercial, etc.;
assistance for all the state institutions,
educational, charitable, and correctional;
close relation with the women's clubs; assistance
to the farmer and the foreigner
in isolated localities; the center for general
culture and love of knowledge where
every citizen may continue to go to school.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: Mr. Lester in his
paper referred to the bill-drafting department
of a legislative reference bureau and
Mr. Brown has just referred to the man behind
the counter. We may perhaps feel
that modern conditions require two men
behind the counter in government: the one
who prepares the ammunition and the one
who fires it; and perhaps the more important
is the one who prepares the ammunition;
the one who draws up the law,
leaving to the legislature the more perfunctory
service of applying the match.
Mr. MATTHEW S. DUDGEON has served
in the capacity of director of the bill drafting
department of the Wisconsin legislative
bureau and I believe that since he has
assumed the duties of the executive officer
of the Wisconsin Library Commission he
has continued to perform that service. We
shall be glad to hear from him this morning

<h2>THE LAW THAT STANDS THE TEST</h2>


<p>In an address before the New York Bar
Association the Honorable Joseph E.
Choate says that we in America are suffering
seriously from plethora of legislation.
He suggests that this whole mass of legislation
pabulum that is made up and offered
to the people from year to year, ought to
be more thoroughly 'Fletcherized,' more
completely masticated, before it is poured
into the body politic for digestion. "If that
were done, I am sure," he says, "that we
could get along with half the quantity and
it would do us just as much good." The
volume of legislation now being considered
is, in fact, appalling. The legislature of
one Eastern state had before it at its last
biennial session four thousand and eighty-one
distinct bills. A Western state this
year has asked its legislature to consider
three thousand, seven hundred and thirty-eight
measures. A Southern state actually
passed at its latest session one thousand,
four hundred and sixty different enactments.</p>

<p>Unlike the hookworm, however, this disease
is neither new nor newly discovered,
nor is it like the chills and fever, indigenous
to our newly settled American continent.
Over three hundred years ago Montaigne
discovered a superabundance of legislation
in France. "We have more laws
in France," he says, "than in all the rest
of the world." And going back still further
to the first century A. D. we find Tacitus
complaining that there are too many laws
in Rome. "So that as formerly we suffered
from wickedness," he says in his Annals,
"so now we suffer from too many laws."</p>

<p>We may safely conclude then that the
enactment of many laws which are not so
fully "Fletcherized" as they should be, is a
complaint which long ago became chronic
among bodies politic generally and that
it is high time that some cure be found
for the ailment. How can the quantity of
laws be diminished and the quality improved?
How can our legislative acts be
masticated so that one-half as many may
do us as much good?</p>

<p>The problem of thus improving legislation
and producing "the law that stands
the test" is indeed a most serious one.</p>

<p><b>Requirements.</b> Let us suggest the proposition
that a law that stands the test must
first be one which violates no provision
of the constitution; second, it must be
founded upon a sound economic basis;
third, it should be capable of efficient administration:
that is, it should be a practical,
workable, usable thing; fourth, it
must fit into its surroundings both legal
and social. It must, as Blackstone has suggested,
fit the situation as a suit of clothes
fits the man. Some laws which are perfectly
sound in good old occidental Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>land
have been found to be entirely impossible
in oriental India. A measure
which suits the Anglo-Saxon Yankee in
Connecticut may be entirely out of place
among the mixed peoples of the Philippines.</p>

<p>The law that stands the test must have
all these qualities and this is the law
which all the American states are striving
to produce. Such a law may, of course,
possess these characteristics and yet not
be in every sense satisfactory. It may not
accomplish all that was hoped for it; it
may contain errors; it may need amendments,
and still it may be a law which, in
a proper sense, stands the test. To give
a method by which a law may be created
which will stand the test will not therefore
be to suggest that a method has been
discovered which will produce perfect legislation.</p>

<p><b>Nature of subjects considered.</b> It should
be remembered also that the difficulties of
legislation arise not only from the multitude
of subjects presented, but because
many of the subjects are in themselves
most difficult of comprehension. The
Right Honorable James Bryce has said
that the task of legislation becomes more
and more difficult and that many of the
problems which legislators now face are
too hard not only for the ordinary members
but even for the abler members of
legislative bodies because they cannot be
understood and mastered without special
knowledge.</p>

<p>To illustrate: The legislature of a middle
western state has had before it at a
single session laws upon the following subjects:
A comprehensive code of court procedure,
initiative and referendum, recall of
all officers except judges, home rule in
cities, excess, condemnation, woman's suffrage,
workmen's compensation, regulation
of industrial accidents by commission,
income tax, state aid to public highways,
conservation and control of water power,
forest reserve, system of industrial education,
system of state life insurance, the
formation of farmers' co-operative associations,
limitation of the hours of labor for
women, child labor, public school buildings
as civic centers, and teachers' pension.</p>

<p>There does not exist in any learned society
nor in any university in the land a
single man who can do more than converse
intelligently upon all of these subjects;
yet this state expected its absolutely
untrained legislators to understand these
matters thoroughly, to express a wise judgment
upon them, and to record their judgment
in such form as to force it upon an
entire state.</p>

<p><b>Lack of training on the part of the legislators.</b>
Of the one hundred members of
the lower house of the legislature which
voted upon all these measures sixty-five
had never had any previous legislative experience.
Only thirty had had the advantage
of any college education. While nineteen
of the one hundred were lawyers, they
were for the most part young, inexperienced
men, whose contact with public
questions had been limited. Thirty of the
one hundred were farmers, thirty-one were
in business, six were doctors or dentists,
eight were mechanics, three were school
teachers. Yet these men, without experience,
or training, or special fitness were
forced to vote upon all these difficult economic
and industrial problems, and also
upon about two thousand other more or
less important measures.</p>

<p><b>Necessity for unbiased information.</b> It
is of course evident that what the legislator
must have is a source from which he
can obtain complete information upon all
sides of a controverted question. A court
which purports to administer justice after
hearing the contention of only one party
to a transaction would open itself to ridicule.
Yet this is precisely the method pursued
in legislation. The legislator begins
without any independent knowledge of the
subject. Such knowledge as he obtains
is brought to him ordinarily by a lobbyist.
He receives many private suggestions
whose source he hardly knows. He attends
a committee hearing on a bill seeking
to increase the taxes levied upon railroad
property, for example. Here the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
data and legal arguments that money can
buy is ably and forcibly presented by the
railroad attorneys. They give figures to
show that the railroads are already taxed
more than other forms of property. They
quote economists to the effect that the
proposed taxation is unsound and unscientific.
They cite court decisions demonstrating
to a certainty that the proposed
measure is unconstitutional. They argue,
wheedle, misstate, and finally convince
the legislator that the measure is absurd.
No similarly exhaustive arguments in behalf
of the bill can be presented, for no
talent comparable to that of the railroad
attorneys, and in fact no talent at all is
retained by the people in behalf of public
interests.</p>

<p>This is the legislative librarian's opportunity.
As the Right Honorable James
Bryce has said: "No country has ever been
able to fill its legislatures with its wisest
men; but every country may at least enable
them to apply the best methods and
provide them with the amplest material."</p>

<p><b>Legislation elsewhere.</b> It is to be remarked
that the legislative questions before
all civilized communities are essentially
similar. Everywhere are problems
growing out of crime and pauperism; problems
relating to hours of labor, child labor,
and wages; employer's liability; compulsory
insurance; workman's compensation;
problems arising out of inheritance, income
taxation, and the regulation of public
service corporations. Nothing is so
new, however, but that some other legislature
has worked upon the problem or is
working upon it. Take, for example, such
a question as employer's liability or workman's
compensation. Fifty legislative
bodies are working upon or have worked
upon this single question. In at least three
foreign countries and in one American
state it has been adequately solved. The
other forty-six have failed in part or altogether,
either because of uneconomic and
unscientific approach or because of constitutional
limitations. Formerly and up to
within the last ten years no effort had
been made to profit by the experience of
these fifty other legislative bodies. The
typical American way is to let the legislators
stumble along, ignorant of the results
of similar experimentations elsewhere, trying
out expensive, independent experiments,
which inevitably end in ineffectual
enactments.</p>

<p>What the legislator most needs to know,
then, is what efforts other communities are
making to solve the problem before him
and how they are succeeding, to the end
that good measures which have succeeded
elsewhere may be adopted and their failures
not repeated. Where successful legislative
work is done the first effort is always
to get copies of every law on every
subject which is likely to be legislated
upon at the current session. All data bearing
upon the success or failure of this legislation
in other states and countries must
be collected, digested, tabulated and placed
in such form as to be readily available to
the legislator. If a measure has failed or
been repealed the reasons for the failure
or repeal are sought. If it has been successful
its provisions are carefully studied
and analyzed with a view to adaptability
to local needs. Experience shows that in
some cases it is necessary to prepare a
translation of good foreign legislation
which has never before been translated
into English.</p>

<p>But no law from another jurisdiction can
be safely transplanted without careful consideration.
The local constitution must be
studied. In such a case as the workman's
compensation act referred to, it was necessary
for a commission to make a close, scientific
study of the causes and character of
the industrial accidents within the state, to
investigate the rates of the casualty insurance
companies in the different industries,
to discover what co-operation for the prevention
of accidents could be secured from
employers and employees. Hearings were
held at various industrial centers within
and without the state; scores of witnesses
were examined; manufacturers, labor
unions, engineering experts and economists
were called upon. In short, the problem
was treated in a thoroughly scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
manner. Contrary to the usual practice,
the case was prepared and presented to
the legislature with the same thoroughness
and care as is usual when an important
case is prepared and presented to the
court. As a result the law, although not
perfect, stands the test.</p>

<p><b>Drafting.</b> When the legislature has discovered
what measures have proved successful
elsewhere and what local conditions
demand, it is still helpless because
the members know nothing of legislative
forms and cannot use with sufficient accuracy
the language expressive of its conclusion.
Assistance in bill drafting is necessary.
Experience has shown that the
man who does this must be either a
trained lawyer who is also a practical political
scientist or a practical political scientist
who is something of a lawyer. It is
often found too that in its original form a
measure is unconstitutional and a lawyer's
knowledge is necessary in order to devise
some means of whipping the constitutional
devil around the judicial stump. For example,
the workman's compensation law of
England, enacted too literally in its original
form, is clearly unconstitutional in
America and has been so declared by the
courts of our state. In another state, however,
the legislative lawyers who were engaged
in drafting the bill, seeing clearly
the judicial stump and the constitutional
devil, by a simple but clever device passed
what was in effect the English law, but in
such form that when it came before the
Supreme Court it was not only declared
constitutional but was commended.</p>

<p><b>Fault not with legislators but with the
system.</b> If legislation be bad the fault is,
then, not with the legislator. The average
legislator is a keen, bright, honest man,
who has been successful in at least a small
way in his business or profession. He is
ignorant of legislative subjects not because
he is an ignorant man, but because his
knowledge is of other things. The fault is
not with him. It is inherent in our unscientific
system of legislating.</p>

<p>We put a group of farmers, grocers, and
mechanics at work upon some great sociological
problem. They can have no adequate
knowledge of the subject. We do
not give them compensation enough to pay
their living expenses while they work.
We allot them only a few hours to consider
a given question. We provide for them
no information. We furnish them with no
legal counsel. Assuming, however, as is
often true, that these men are men of integrity
and humanity and common sense
and that their ideas are sound, they enact
a good law that forbids, for example, the
employment of children in hazardous and
immoral surroundings. In this they have
accomplished an important and intelligent
constructive work.</p>

<p>Then we hire the best trained minds in
the state and put them in our courts. We
pay them higher salaries than any other
public servants. We give them large libraries
in which is found the accumulated
legal lore of the past. We grant them, for
the questions before them, all the time
they can use,&mdash;weeks, months, often literally
years. These talented, high-minded
gentlemen, by dint of industrious delving
and assisted by highly paid and highly
trained attorneys, discover at last in the
depths of their moth-eaten law books some
mummified eighteenth century idea which
has become petrified into a constitutional
provision. They shake their heads and decide
that the splendid, humane, up-to-date,
common sense legislation is unconstitutional
and void because of some minor constitutional
objection. They cannot be, and
should not be, criticised, for they are clearly
performing a duty. Neither can these
judges substitute anything in place of the
law which they destroy, for the work for
which we pay them so well in money and
honor and position is only critical,&mdash;and
their function is in this case destructive.</p>

<p><b>The law making function as important
as the judicial.</b> Now, creative work the
world over has always been recognized as
requiring greater intelligence, better training,
keener initiative than the purely critical.
Yet, in legal matters this principle
has been entirely ignored. In every way
we exalt the interpretive, critical, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
destructive, judicial process. We neglect
and belittle the constructive creative process
of law making.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the whole matter is
that the making of the law is in principle
as important,&mdash;in fact, more important,
than the interpretation of it.</p>

<p>The legislative function must be as carefully
performed as is the judicial. Men
should be prepared for law making as are
men for the judicial bench. They must be
men of the same calibre, of good ability, of
high intelligence, of absolute integrity, of
broad sympathies, and of big vision. Not
until we have an agency of this type assisting
in law making, not until the making of
laws is recognized as a distinct and important
governmental function, co-ordinate
with, if not superior to the judicial function,
not until each state has a bureau
which will, as the Honorable James Bryce
says, supply the legislators with the amplest
material and enable them to apply
the best methods, can we hope to have
laws which in the highest sense "stand
the test."</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: We go now from the
legislature to the business man, the man
who makes the wheels turn around. Those
of you who had the opportunity to hear the
striking address, at a meeting of the
Special Libraries Association the other
day, from a business man of Boston need
not be reminded of the tremendous possibilities
that lie in this extension of the
library service. Mr. S. H. RANCK, of the
Grand Rapids public library, will discuss</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>MAKING A LIBRARY USEFUL TO BUSINESS
MEN</h2>


<p>On first giving consideration to this paper
I was inclined to believe that the story
of the personal use of the library (the
public library) by business men would be
almost as brief as the traditional story of
snakes in Ireland. Few librarians have the
means of knowing how many business men
use their institutions, but where statistics
of registration indicate the occupation
of card holders it would appear that the
library gets almost as many bartenders as
bankers.</p>

<p>To get some definite data on this subject
I had the library records investigated
of the 198 officers and committees of the
Grand Rapids Association of Commerce,
the leading business organization of our
city, with a membership of 1,300. These
198 men (and a few women) represent our
most active business concerns, as well as
a few professions. Of this number only 53,
or 27 per cent, have live library cards. In
looking over the names I recognized 38 of
those without cards as persons who either
individually or through their employees in
the interest of the house, have used the library
more or less for reference purposes.
There are of course others who use the library
in this way without my knowledge.</p>

<p>These figures indicate that the library
is serving directly only about 50 per cent
of the livest business men of the town.
The specific questions I propose to discuss
are, Why do business men use the library
relatively little? What can the library do
to get business men to use it more?</p>

<p>Progressive business men use the library
because they recognize the enormous
value of new ideas and of new knowledge
to their business, no matter where they
get them. The trouble is that public libraries
can't always furnish them the
knowledge they need. And furthermore
not all business men are progressive.
There are standpatters in the business, as
well as in the political world. However,
there is no class of men who have a better
idea of the potential power of print, rightly
used, than the business men who advertise.
Such men are always ready to meet
the library more than half way.</p>

<p>In discussing this question I should have
preferred to use the term "business men"
in a liberal sense. We are all more or less
"business" people at times, but for this occasion
I am directed by our president to
limit it to that one of its 24 different meanings
which applies to employer rather than
employee in "the occupations of conducting
trade or monetary transactions" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
in "employments requiring knowledge of
accounts and financial methods."</p>

<p>Before proceeding further permit me to
state my conviction that the greatest service
the library is doing for business men
is not to business men personally, but
rather for them through their employees,&mdash;in
supplying knowledge and in promoting
the general intelligence and the social welfare
of the community. These things are
of the greatest importance to every employer,
for they are the foundations on
which all efficiency is built. The social
welfare work of the Panama Canal, much
of it the kind libraries are doing, is a conspicuous
example of the immense financial
value of such work.</p>

<p>The male portion of adult society we
may roughly divide, so far as occupations
are concerned, into manual workers (laborers
and mechanics), professional men,
business men, and drones (the idle class)
who, like the lilies of the field, neither toil
nor spin, but who frequently outshine Solomon
in the gorgeousness and variety of
their array. They live a parasitic life on
the productive labor of their fellow men,
giving no adequate return. In the administration
of our public libraries most consideration
has been given to the idle class
and to the professional classes. Real service
for the manual workers and business
men has been largely neglected until within
recent years.</p>

<p>There are several reasons for this neglect.
Among these may be mentioned
the following: Working men and business
men are expressing themselves in deeds
and in things rather than in words and
books; and therefore until recently there
has been relatively little worth-while material
available for the libraries to put on
their shelves for the men directly engaged
in industrial or commercial pursuits. Furthermore
there has been a long standing
prejudice on the part of these men (those
who are rule-of-thumb men) against the reliability
and the utility of things in print
for their everyday work. And in certain
quarters this prejudice still exists to a very
considerable extent. They are inclined to
look upon the writers and users of books
as theoretical and impractical.</p>

<p>A further handicap in the use of libraries
by business men, is the fact that
so few of us in library work know the contents
of books and things in print that
might be useful to them in their daily
work; and oftener we know still less of the
problems business men must deal with.
Therefore we cannot relate the inside of
books with their work.</p>

<p>Much of the work of the public library is
a kind of salesmanship, even though there
is no direct exchange of the coin of the
country. Salesmanship in its best sense
is service, and service is what a city is
buying for all its people when it puts into
its annual budget a more or less (usually
less) adequate sum of money for its library.
As things are today I fear that in
too many cases the public instead of drawing
a plum from the library pie is not infrequently
handed a lemon.</p>

<p>Recently I had the pleasure of dining
with the vice-president of a department
store that employs over 2,500 people to sell
nothing but clothes&mdash;wearing apparel. He
told me that the great secret of the success
of his institution, through whose doors
there enter from 30,000 to 40,000 people
every day (and remember that nearly all
these people enter with the expectation of
parting with some of their good money),
is the fact that every employee has instilled
into him or her the fact that the
salesmanship that brings success is service
and that it is founded on knowledge;
for, said he, "No one can sell goods satisfactorily
unless he knows all about them,"&mdash;where
they are made, how they are made,
what they are, their history, etc. And
these things everyone in this store is systematically
taught. Incidentally, I may
add that this department store starts its
people at a minimum wage higher than the
minimum in many libraries, and the maximum
for women in this store is double the
maximum of the highest paid women in library
work in this country. This store
uses the public library of its city and has
a library of its own whose librarian is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
this convention at the expense of the store.
When a department store finds such a policy
a wise one the business men responsible
for its management will be the first
in the community to support a policy of library
service based on knowledge. But
business men must be shown that the library
is delivering the goods.</p>

<p>The business man places his establishment
so far as possible where it will best
serve the purposes of his business, and he
spends loads of good money in the first
place, and annually in the form of taxation,
to get his building at the right place. Besides
getting his establishment at the right
place he also spends more loads of good
money to arrange it for the economic and
expeditious handling of his affairs in it.
So far as libraries relate to serving the
business man, as well as nine-tenths of the
other people in the community, I am convinced
that 95 per cent of the library buildings
of the country are badly located, and
furthermore that the large proportion of
these buildings are badly arranged for the
work they have, or ought, to do.</p>

<p>The place to serve the people is where
the people daily congregate and pass by in
the largest numbers. This is never on a
side street or in the "best" residence section
of the city. Your average "best" citizen
today gets more satisfaction out of his
public library in showing his visitor from
out of town the Greek temple set back in
a beautiful grove or garden as he whirls by
in his six cylinder, 60 horse-power, seven-passenger
touring car than in using the
books and periodicals inside. Such a building
in such a setting has a value as a
work of art, but not as a library for service.
Incidentally, it is only fair to say that
business men in most of our cities are
largely responsible that we have library
buildings for show rather than for use.</p>

<p>Every block that separates the library
from the principal lines of the movement
of the people, every foot that people must
walk from the sidewalk to the entrance of
the building and then to its books, every
step that must be climbed above the level
of the sidewalk to reach the first floor, are
all so many hurdles, barriers, which the
people are obliged to overcome before they
can get to their own books, whether it be
to use them for business or pleasure, for
education or recreation. The bad location
and arrangement of library buildings
in the United States are keeping hundreds
of thousands of potential users and supporters
of libraries away from them and
out of them every day of the year. And
there is no class of persons in the community
more affected by such things than
business men, for they recognize (consciously
or unconsciously) better than any
other class the commercial value of time
and convenience.</p>

<p>Let me put this a little more concretely.
The library building in which I work is
better located and arranged than the average
library building of the country. And
yet the total distance walked to and from
the sidewalk by all those who enter that
building daily is nearly 35 miles to the
point where the library begins to serve
them. Furthermore each one of the thousand
and more persons who daily enter
this building, in addition to the energy he
uses in walking 180 feet to and from the
sidewalk must lift his own weight and the
weight of the books he carries seven feet
above the level of the sidewalk. In other
words the location and arrangement of
this building with reference to the sidewalk
requires the people who use it daily
to take an extra walk of almost the distance
from Baltimore to Washington and
at the same time carry a weight equal to
that of a ton of coal 350 feet to the top of
a skyscraper and down again. And all this
is in addition to the walk of 450 feet from
the nearest car line, which few people use,
800 feet from the car lines which are generally
used, and over 400 feet from the
nearest thoroughfare. The library to be a
friend to man, and to serve him, must
"live in a house by the side of the road
where the race of men go by."</p>

<p>The business man who studies usually
buys his own printed matter that deals
directly with his work, and in this respect
he is usually far ahead of the library both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
in knowledge and in material at hand; and
the bigger his business the more is this
likely to be the case. The librarian will
almost invariably find such a man a most
helpful person in the selection of things
to be purchased and in the relative value
of both authors and books. It should be
the business of every librarian to know
intimately, as far as possible, all such men
in the community.</p>

<p>Our public libraries must largely increase
on their shelves the number of
things in print that are of real service to
the business man in his work. First of all
we must know what these things are, and
next we need to have the nerve to spend
money for them much more freely than we
have ever done before. This is expensive
and most such expenditures will not show
in the statistics of circulation. As an illustration
of this let me refer again to the
institution I have the honor to serve. For
a number of years we have been spending
$400 a year for books in only one line of
business. Besides the books, we take some
two dozen current periodicals on the same
subject. All are used to a considerable extent
and the use made of them by only a
dozen men is of the greatest commercial
and financial importance to our city. And
yet so far as the figures of circulation are
concerned the expenditure of $450 of our
annual book fund for this one business is
practically nothing.</p>

<p>We must get away from the idea of
measuring the usefulness or the efficiency
of the library by the number of books issued
for home use. So long as this idea
dominates our public library work we can
never do our best for the community, and
especially the business part of it.</p>

<p>We need of course many books for the
business man in our circulating departments,
but these by no means meet the
need. Many of these books are out of date
in a few years at the best. To keep up to
date there is necessary a liberal purchase
of yearbooks, transactions and publications
of industrial, technical and commercial
associations which bring down to date
annually, and in convenient form, the latest
knowledge in their respective fields.
For progressive business men such works
are vastly more important than encyclopedias,
important as encyclopedias of all
kinds are.</p>

<p>Then too we must pay greater respect
to the material published in pamphlet
form. On a multitude of subjects some of
the latest and best things have appeared
in this form. Most of us do not handle
this material properly, if at all. In many
libraries pamphlets are regarded and cared
for with about the same degree of disrespect
as were public documents in most
libraries twenty years ago, and I regret to
say, in many libraries today. And as for
the public use made of pamphlets, it is
practically nothing.</p>

<p>But more important for the wide-awake
business man than books, documents and
pamphlets, is a large collection of current
periodicals relating to every kind of business
activity in your city, with clipping
files on many subjects, for it is only
through these that it is possible to keep
up with the latest information or for the
library to supply the thing that is most
needed at the minute. As an illustration
of such use I recall several recent instances
of business men getting up briefs
in connection with the proposed Underwood
tariff bill. The latest information,
even when compiled sometimes by government
authorities, was secured from
technical or trade journals before it could
be received from the Government Printing
Office.</p>

<p>In short the best work the library can do
for the business men personally is in the
building itself, supplemented by extensive
use of the telephone and the mails (reference
or information work if you please),
and not by issuing to them for home use
books whose information at the best is
rarely less than a year old, but in reality
is more likely to be five, ten, or even
twenty years old. The circulating book
has a most important place and I would
not for one moment take from it the importance
that is its due. My plea is that
we recognize more fully for our business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
man, and especially the so-called small
business man&mdash;the man of small business,
or the young man who hopes to establish
a business of his own, the great importance
of library assistants who know the
contents and the relative value of books,
pamphlets and periodicals, and who understand
the art of library salesmanship
whereby the business man gets the things
he really needs.</p>

<p>And then when we have done all this&mdash;have
librarians who know, and the things
in print the business man needs, this one
thing more we must do, we must let the
business man know what we have for his
particular problem and how we can serve
him. The library must advertise the utility
of ideas and of knowledge in the every
day work of the world as well as advertise
its resources and its service.</p>

<p>The best advertising is that which comes
from a well served patron. But our libraries
have thrown away one of the best
means of publicity by locating their buildings
where people must go out of their way
to find them and by so arranging them
that the passerby sees nothing but stone,
brick and glass&mdash;things that suggest nothing
of the joy and usefulness of books.
Seeing great crowds enjoying and using
books, as well as seeing attractive things
in print through properly arranged show
windows, would appeal to the average library
user in a way that would simply
compel his interest and attention in the
things we have for him.</p>

<p>The architecture of the average library
building suggests a tomb&mdash;a place for dead
ones&mdash;rather than a place chock-full of the
things that appeal with tremendous force
to the soul that is alive with the throbbing
impulses of this wonderful time in
which we live.</p>

<p>Since our buildings deny us this great
means of publicity which the show window
enables every merchant to use to such
great advantage, we must use as best we
may such means as we find available. In
a general way I may state my conviction
that we should make a much larger use
of the specific personal appeal as over
against general publicity, though the latter
is also necessary. When a man has a definite
task assigned him put the resources
and service of your library directly up to
him for his particular problem, especially
if the problem is one a little outside the
circle of his regular business. It will come
to him at the psychological moment and
he is most likely to act on your suggestion;
whereas had it come to him as a general
statement before he was personally
interested most likely it would have been
promptly forgotten. As a part of our regular
routine letters from the library go to
all such persons, as we see their names
in the newspapers, on programs, etc.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the Associated Advertising
Clubs of America early this month
in Baltimore I had the pleasure of "getting
next" to some of the livest business
men in the country. The thing that impressed
me most was not the interesting
exhibitions there shown or the various
"stunts" that were pulled off, but the new
note that some of the men were striking.
It was this: "Business and business efficiency
for service rather than for profit."
This is a high ideal, worthy of any profession,
and I venture the prediction that it
will be men of this type who will more and
more dominate the business world of the
future. Such men will appreciate and support
the public library more than business
men have ever done before; but they will
also require more. To get their support
we as librarians must think less of measuring
our efficiency in terms of circulation
statistics, a kind of impersonal, bookkeeping
standard, but more of measuring it in
terms of human service&mdash;human service
not only for the business man, but for
every man, every woman and every child
in all this vast continent of America.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: Great as is the opportunity
of the public library to serve the
business man, it can't do it all, for so
highly specialized are some of the departments
of interest of the various business
houses that no public library without a
treasury like that of our millionaire concerns
could hope to undertake a work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
that character. Therefore, each large
business concern necessarily must supplement
the resources of the public library by
means of library facilities of its own. We
shall hear something of this form of work
this morning in the paper which is to be
presented by one of the most successful of
the libraries of this type, that of H. M.
Byllesby &amp; Co. of Chicago, whose librarian,
Miss LOUISE B. KRAUSE, will give us
the paper.</p>

<h2>LIBRARIES IN BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS:
THEIR EXPANDING
FUNCTION</h2>


<p>The service which books render mankind
may in general be designated as falling
into two classes; namely, books for inspiration
and books for information. Dismissing
the use of books as a means of inspiration,
because the subject does not fall
within the scope of this paper, let us consider
the most important use to which
printed information can be put, in the service
of mankind. At first thought it might
seem that the use of the printed page for
purposes of information reached its highest
service in the function of education,
but granted that it does not play an important
part in education, we know education
to be something vastly larger than a
mere knowledge of facts, and we also
know that many men and women who are
repositories of information derived from
the printed page do not always put it into
operation for the best welfare of their fellows;
for, as James Russell Lowell has
said, "There is nothing less profitable than
scholarship for the mere sake of scholarship;"
and truly scholarship without the
ultimate purpose of practical service is one
of the most selfish possessions in the
world.</p>

<p>Let us therefore exclude the use of
printed information in the service of education
as its highest form of usefulness
and consider the following statement. The
use of print in furnishing information performs
its most important service in the
function which it exercises in modern business,
because it is business which lays
hold of abstract science and knowledge
and puts them into practical operation for
the greatest benefit to mankind; for the
commercial age in which we live is not a
sordid age, but an age which is distinctly
marked by the development and conservation
of resources for the supplying of
man's needs, by means of the extension of
applied science into the field of business.
Now lest this statement should be too abstract,
and the speaker be accused in the
words of Leonard Merrick of "voicing the
sentiments of the unthinking in stately language,"
let us consider this proposition for
a moment in the concrete. It is business
enterprise that has brought about, through
the perfection of the steam engine, the
swiftness and convenience which we enjoy
in twentieth century travel by railroad. It
is business that has brought the service
of the telephone and telegraph to their
highest perfection. It is business that has
developed artificial lighting by gas and
electricity and emancipated us from candles
and kerosene lamps. It is business
that is transforming raw and waste materials
by the application of pure science,
into products of service and value for the
needs of innumerable homes, in addition
to perfecting agricultural machinery, and
producing fertilizers to enrich the land,
thereby making possible the production of
better crops. Thus we might continue to
multiply illustrations of how business enterprise
has equipped us with the means of
meeting great needs which at various
times have seriously threatened the welfare
of human life. This fact of the application
of abstract science to the world's
practical needs, through the medium of
business enterprise, has become permanently
recognized by institutions of learning,
as seen in the establishment of technical
schools, schools of commerce and
finance, and instruction in business administration,
for, as a recent writer in the
Journal of Political Economy has said,
"The methods of American industry are
rapidly being intellectualized."</p>

<p>A variety of professional work of which
engineering and chemistry are noteworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
examples are also carried on by large business
organizations, and we find professional
men of the highest rank as prime
movers in large commercial enterprises.
(In this connection it might not be amiss
to state that out of an experience as university
librarian and business librarian the
speaker is inclined to think that the professional
business man keeps more adequately
informed and up to date on his
specialties than does the average university
professor.)</p>

<p>An additional fact which bears directly
on the general subject under discussion is,
that the age in which we live is not only
a business age, but that it is an age
marked by the magnitude of its business
organizations; an age of "big business," as
some one has called it; and because of the
economic conditions of our advancing civilization,
business will undoubtedly continue
to be "big business" even though
subjected to federal and state regulation.
Now correlating these two facts, namely,
that modern business is conducted by
means of large organizations and that its
success is based upon the intelligent application
of scientific knowledge to practical
needs, we have cleared the way for an appreciation
of the function of printed information
as embodied in the work of libraries
in business organizations.</p>

<p>The business organization builds up its
own library, first, on account of the convenience
of having close at hand the information
constantly needed by its workers,
and subject to no borrowing restrictions,
which would be inevitable even if
the facilities of outside libraries were
available; and second, on account of the
necessity for careful selection of material
particularly adapted to its individual
needs. Business organizations have for
many years collected information in a desultory
manner, but it has been only in the
last few years that some of them have
awakened to the fact that more was
needed than mere collection of printed information,
and for the same reason that
they were availing themselves of all modern
devices for the quick and adequate
handling of their various products and
were systematizing their methods to obtain
more efficient results, so they must
lay hold of modern library methods under
experienced supervision if they were to
keep up with the steadily growing and important
mass of printed information.
Therefore we find business organizations
securing the services of professional library
workers, trained to use books in the
broadest and most practical manner. Some
hesitation was at first expressed in various
quarters as to whether so-called professional
library methods used in public
and university libraries were suited to
business library needs, and as to whether
library workers educated for general library
work would adequately meet the
business library situation. In fact it was
intimated that the business librarian was
a worker of a different brand than the ordinary
librarian and therefore he had both
knowledge and needs which set him apart
from his library fellows, in a special class
by himself. Out of four years' experience
as a business librarian the speaker takes
pleasure in stating that practical experience
has proved the fallacy of both of
these conceptions. It is true that business
librarians are called upon to exercise
certain functions which the librarians of
public and university libraries are not, but
which any efficient head of a public or university
library would be quite capable of
exercising if the occasion demanded it. In
fact the recent rise of library interest in
business men and their needs can be directly
traced to the heads of some of our
public libraries and the work they have inaugurated
in making their libraries as
helpful as possible to all classes of citizens.</p>

<p>The characterization of the function of
libraries in business organizations by the
word "expanding" in the title assigned to
this paper by the President of the American
Library Association, is most apt, and
indicative of the real status of the case.
The business library is in a process of
evolution, and just what the final result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
will be, it is a little too early in its development
to state.</p>

<p>The elemental idea of the function of a
business library that was held by the officers
of the business organization with
which the speaker is most familiar, was
to have the books and data which were
the property of the company, classified
and cataloged so that material could be
found quickly, and a librarian was employed
solely on the basis of this need.</p>

<p>With the acquisition of a librarian the
library situation soon changed from the
inquiry for certain definite books and periodicals,
to the inquiry as to whether the
company had any specific information on
a given subject, and if not as to whether
printed information on the subject was
available elsewhere and how quickly it
could be obtained.</p>

<p>The evolution in the function of a library
from that of furnishing a definite
book asked for, to furnishing all the information
obtainable on a given subject as
quickly as possible is decidedly expensive,
and the what, how and where of the case
would furnish ample material for a separate
paper.</p>

<p>The evolution in the function of the library
did not stop at this point; for it
was soon expected that the librarian would
understand the specific interests of the
members of the organization, and to a certain
degree think for them in keeping up
with the field of print and in bringing to
their attention, without a request on their
part, certain facts of which they would
like to be cognizant. To this duty was
added the forecasting of possible future
needs, and the collection of information in
advance of rush demands.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the work of modern
business organizations requires the division
of labor into a number of departments,
and the workers in any one department
may not always be acquainted with
the information which may be available in
another department. The library, by keeping
in touch with individuals in all departments,
becomes a central bureau of information
in being able to refer the members
of one department to those in another who
possess the particular information desired.</p>

<p>The business library also assembles and
files the manuscript data of original research
conducted by members of the organization,
materials which constitute one
of its valuable assets. Research data in
the possession of business corporations is
often a worthy contribution to scholarship.
An illustration of this fact was recently
brought to the attention of the speaker,
by the statement of a university student,
who said that in making a study of the
drinking waters of a certain state the only
analyses of waters on record were those
which a railroad had made primarily for
the purpose of ascertaining the suitability
of the waters for boiler use on locomotives.</p>

<p>In addition to these briefly outlined functions,
which are more or less technical, attention
should be directed to several others,
lest a mistaken impression be given
that business library work is entirely technical
in its nature.</p>

<p>Business men are often called upon to
serve the public as good citizens in various
capacities, and also to serve as officers
or on committees of national business
organizations, and thus have interests outside
of their regular company work. Their
librarian is expected to assist in any need
which arises by reason of these outside interests,
and not only may be called upon
to furnish information but also to do editorial
work in preparing material for publication.</p>

<p>The welfare and education of employees
has also become a prominent feature in
the work of many large business corporations,
and the library is expected to be a
prominent factor in this work, as it is the
logical educational center of the organization.
Some of our business libraries
have recently been drawn rather deeply
into welfare work with the result that certain
phases of practical library service are
being neglected. It does not seem advisable,
however, that the business librarian
should annex any line of welfare work
which does not legitimately center in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
library; for the librarian is best fitted to
serve the interests of the organization by
maintaining high standards of efficient library
service rather than by annexing
other kinds of work belonging solely to
the sphere of a social worker. This is particularly
important at the present stage of
business library development, as the business
world in many sections has not yet
learned what professional library service
really is, and how to utilize it most effectively.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the business
world except for comparatively few organizations
is not utilizing the undoubtedly valuable
service which professional librarians
are able to render, and that the American
Library Association has always endeavored
to extend the use of books and their
widest application, it might not be amiss
to suggest that it would be legitimate work
for the American Library Association with
its library prestige and well known motives
of personal disinterestedness, to undertake
a campaign of education to bring
before business men the subject of what
library work really is, and the character of
service it is prepared to render; for in
these days of the over-emphasized and
often superficial cry for more efficiency,
there is no line of work that is more genuinely
efficient than that of the trained
librarian. The information, to be put before
business men, should be free from library
technicalities and details, and its
arguments should be framed, not to enlighten
librarians, but to convince busy
men of affairs possessed of shrewd judgment
and large foresight, as to the practical
worth of the matter as a business
proposition. For library work in business
organizations is no longer a theory or a
tentative experiment, but has proved itself
in the firms adopting it to be an integral
part of the successful work of the corporation.
This fact is well illustrated by a
bulletin recently issued by a large business
firm, in which it endeavored to put
before the public, in a pamphlet entitled
"Why it is qualified" the value of the consulting
services of one of its departments,
and among the prominent reasons given
under "Why it is qualified" is the fact of
the commercial library maintained by the
company, with the library's particular resources
under competent supervision.</p>

<p>Because printed information has proved
to be an integral factor in the successful
prosecution of business and because it can
be most effectively utilized by means of
professional library methods, therefore,
the business library hopes to take its place
in the ranks of the American Library Association
as one in purpose with all libraries
in the realization of a common
ideal, namely, the largest possible use of
books in the practical service of mankind.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: I have just received
a message that Mr. McAneny will be here
in a very short time. In the few moments
intervening it might be well perhaps to
discuss some of the trenchant papers
which we have had this morning.</p>

<p>Miss AHERN: Mr. President, I would
like to take exception to one thing Mr.
Ranck said in his paper. I do not believe
that the idea that the contents of books
are useful to men in the business world is
of recent date. I think, perhaps, the second
statement that these things have only
come recently into the arrangement of resources
of the library is the truer one. We
certainly have had knowledge of chemistry
and of geology and technical knowledge in
manufacture for many, many years, only
many librarians have been more interested
in the purely educational or inspirational
part of the library and have neglected that
large field of usefulness and that large
company of people who contribute to the
welfare of work and of the world, as Miss
Krause has pointed out. The best chemists
in the country are being sought by the
business houses; the best knowledge of
soils, of minerals, of woods, of lumber, of
stone has long been sought by the men
who are making a commercial use of these
things. And their information is not held
in reserve: it is all in printed form and
only the scope of the librarian's knowledge
of where things may be obtained in the
world of print places the limit on this ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>terial
for the library shelves. And so I
hope that librarians will not say that books
on these subjects, that material on these
subjects is a recent product. It is our
knowledge of them, a knowledge that this
is a part of the province of library work,
that makes for recent activity.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: Mr. Ranck is here to
answer for himself. The statement has
been challenged and he can answer it.</p>

<p>Mr. RANCK: I think there is not so
much difference between the view I take
and the view taken by Miss Ahern. I do
not know that I followed my manuscript
very closely at that point, but what I had
in mind was the business man rather than
the professional, technical man. I fully
grant what Miss Ahern says with reference
to technical subjects, scientific subjects,
and so on. As I said, I think there is no
radical disagreement between Miss
Ahern's and my position. There may be a
misunderstanding.</p>

<p>Miss AHERN: I was not questioning
what Mr. Ranck had said, but, rather, removing
any excuse that the library folk
may put to themselves for a lack of interest
or a lack of activity along this line by
saying that the material was scant or hard
to command.</p>

<p>Dr. ANDREWS: There is the other side,
that Miss Krause's paper emphasized and
which Miss Ahern seems to neglect. Miss
Krause's paper states that American industry
is becoming intellectualized, and
that this is a great factor in the development
of business life. It ought also to be
an extra incentive to the public library to
meet the demands. I think that much of
this development in the technical side of
library work has come from the increasing
study by business men of their own world
and that we ought to remember that while
the public libraries have neglected in the
past to furnish business men with what
they wanted, yet the latter did not want it
then as much as they do now.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: Those of us&mdash;and I
assume that that means every librarian&mdash;who
read the June number of the World's
Work were impressed by one strong article
therein concerning the growing magnitude
of municipal administration and the great
problems that confront those who are
charged with such administration. Without
repeating to you the very striking comparisons
which the author made with some
of the governmental functions of states
and even some of the kingdoms of Europe,
showing the tremendous problems confronting
the municipal officials, problems
of tremendous budgets, of great public
works, and so on, it will be sufficient for
me to say that it is a happy omen that we
are now getting into the public service
men of high civic ideals and constructive
ability and who are replacing men whose
self-seeking interests or vanity led them to
seek the votes of their fellow citizens. I
am glad that we have with us today a man
of this high type. I need not say further
concerning him because we took advantage
of his absence to get from Mr.
Bowker a pretty good who's-who bearing
upon himself, and I shall simply introduce
to you at this time to speak to us upon
the subject of "The municipal reference
library as an aid in city administration,"
the Honorable GEORGE McANENY, president
of the borough of Manhattan, New
York.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>THE MUNICIPAL REFERENCE LIBRARY
AS AN AID IN CITY ADMINISTRATION</h2>


<p>It is a very real pleasure to meet with
the American Library Association, and to
convey in behalf of my colleagues in the
administration of the City of New York,
and in behalf of other colleagues in public
business throughout the country, our hearty
congratulations and possibly a friendly
warning and a word of appeal.</p>

<p>Congratulations are due you for having
established on so high a plane and in so
short a time the profession of librarian.
Especially are you to be congratulated for
having welcomed the new profession of
municipal reference librarian; for your
adaptability in the constant extension of
the reference work, and for the resiliency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
which is showing again in another field
that real Father Williams never grow old.
Could Benjamin Franklin look upon this
gathering, and hear your reports of social
service, through circulating, home, reference
and municipal reference libraries, I
am sure that no fruit of his patriotism
would seem to him more promising than
the recent application of the circulating
library idea to government affairs.</p>

<p>My friendly warning has to do with your
requests to fiscal bodies for appropriations.
In many parts of the country, there is
the feeling that the less the library has
to do with public officials the better it is
for the library, consequently, as a short
cut, we find compulsory minimum appropriations&mdash;so
many mills or so many parts
of mills for library development. We also
find that too many towns are satisfied with
this compulsory minimum tax, and that
the only time their fiscal representatives
hear about libraries is just before the budget
appropriations are voted. You must
be indulgent with those who vote the
money, if the outcome of this habit suggests
the man who was exasperated by his
wife, who he said "just nagged and nagged
him for money, when he came, when he
left, on Sunday, always." Finally, when a
neighbor summoned the courage to ask,
"What in the world does she do with all
the money?" he, perforce, must answer;
"Well, I don't know; you see I haven't
given her any yet." Councils and Mayors
will understand your library problem best
if you will help them understand at those
quieter seasons of the year when they are
not harassed, as they are at budget time,
by appeals from every other city department
and for every other thing.</p>

<p>When presenting your budget, give the
fiscal officer credit for wanting to know
the whole truth, and for wanting reasons
for giving you the money you request.
Seldom will it help to ask for a great deal
more than you need. Always, it will help
not to present in a single total items that
do not belong together. Classify your budget.
State your program clearly. If all
the money you want is not voted this year,
stick clearly to the plan that has been
voted, and show both the fiscal authorities
and the town where your service has been
crippled, if at all, for want of funds. It
will be well to begin your budget campaign
so that the first idea which the public
and the fiscal officers get is that of the
service you wish to render, rather than
the money you wish to get. Most library
budgets, like most other budgets of the
United States, are apt to be put in without
the explanatory matter which alone
will make the dollar-and-cent facts show
social reasons for library support.</p>

<p>Now for my appeal. In asking you to
consider certain needs of public business,
I want to speak quite frankly, as a city
official who, like thousands of other city
and county officials, must step into other
people's business, with no time for getting
acquainted with detail, and with a
public to deal with that not only expects
us on the first day we take office to use
all the machinery of our predecessor and
to get better results, but also really expects
us to fail. We inherit a stack of
mail. We are flooded with suggestions
and complaints; many of them in confidence
and most of them confusing. We are
urged to attend club and church meetings,
and dinners, and graduating exercises. We
are expected, without any change in subordinate
personnel, while giving our attention
to large community problems and to
the political aspects of public works, to
get an efficient product out of our employees,
no matter who they are or what
they have been. In most places, we find
no disinterested adviser, either on the inside
or on the outside.</p>

<p>Such a situation would not necessarily
be serious if we stepped into a thoroughly
efficient organization where every employee
and supervisor had his place, and where
the institution as such had its "continuing
memory." When Mr. Rea succeeded Mr.
McCrea as president of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, he inherited a splendid organization,
every part related to another part;
a system under which experts had tabulated
within a moment's reach the suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>cesses
and the failures of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, and the costs of its various contracts,
the difference between estimates
and final costs, and an efficiency ranking
both of its various employees and its stations.
When the present administration
in New York City stepped into office, we
inherited an aggregation of departments
and divisions then spending&mdash;if we count
in installments and interest paid on the
city debt&mdash;more than $160,000,000 for the
expenses of a single year. There were
ninety thousand employees. Side by side
with one another were clerks paid one $600
and another $1,800 for the same kind of
work; in another grade were clerks paid
$1,600 and others paid $2,400 for the same
kind of work. When salaries had been
increased, and why, was not a matter of
record. Supplies were contracted for by
no standard form. Specifications, either
for supplies or for construction work, were
worded differently at different times, according
to the individual wish or whim of
the department officer preparing them. The
public was but poorly protected at any
point. Plans were made for new buildings,
for new roads, and for other vast improvements,
often without estimates of cost;
often with assurances of only slight cost,
where, too frequently, cost had been estimated
as an entering wedge only. Thus
a great city would stumble into an experiment
or public improvement demanding
millions of dollars, without ever reckoning
the ultimate amount of its obligation.
For example it may be fair in this presence
to recall that the first bill for the New
York public library carried with it an
appropriation of $2,500,000. The city decided
to spend this $2,500,000 and actually
it spent $10,000,000. The New York public
library is worth every dollar it cost, ten
times over; I am merely emphasizing that
the public should have had its eyes open
and, in this case as in every other, should
have known what it was doing. Although
this same gap occurred over and over again&mdash;between
estimate and actual cost&mdash;no
steps were taken to recall the fact when
each new amount was under consideration.</p>

<p>Ignorant as we have been of our own
experience, still less informed have we
been regarding the experience of neighbor
cities. Some years ago, Denver, in operating
its street railway, found it expedient
to substitute electric motor power for the
old cables. After Denver had discarded
these cables, Baltimore adopted the cable.
Rochester has recently adopted a device
to attach drinking fountains to its ordinary
fire hydrants. The idea is a new one, and
may prove valuable. I say it merely by
way of instance; but if it is a good idea,
New York City and your city should adopt
it. Each successive experiment of the sort
should, at least, be brought promptly to
the attention of public officials.</p>

<p>Again, New York City has worked out
an improved system of accounting and
budget making. The village of Dobb's
Ferry, the cities of Duluth and Cincinnati
have used an improvement upon New
York's budget exhibits&mdash;recently called a
new kind of "confidence game"&mdash;that is,
taking the public into official confidence
about the public's own business. Instead
of waiting a generation for cities to adopt
these new methods, their officials should
promptly be given the facts they need.</p>

<p>Is it not criminal waste and error for
one city to introduce a system of sewer
disposal, or of milk regulation, which another
city has found endangering the lives
of its citizens? If a measure has proved
bad and dangerous for one city, modern
science in the hands of a librarian should
make it unnecessary for every other city
to go through the same experience.</p>

<p>To help us in ending all this waste, and
to help us, in short, in putting city government
upon a thorough scientific and efficient
basis, the municipal reference library
is beginning to take its highly important
place. Without a municipal reference library,
it will in future be difficult for any
administrative officer to do his best. I will
not attempt to review the laborious steps
of my colleagues in the present board of
estimate and apportionment&mdash;our govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>ing
municipal body&mdash;to incorporate into
standard specifications, standard salaries
and standard contracts the memory of our
past failures, so that we may hold the
gains that we have made and avoid the
weaknesses and the errors of our experience.
But I venture some suggestions as
to a reference library that, although general
in their application, will indicate our
reasons for establishing such a library in
New York.</p>

<p>Our reasons for placing the library in our
new Municipal Building&mdash;as we propose
to do&mdash;apply everywhere. It must be made
easy for officials to get information, and
for the librarian to get the information
promptly and directly to the officials. It is
not enough to know that it may be had.
To have important information an hour
away from the office is almost as bad as
to have it a thousand miles away. It must
be easier for the busy official to get the
information he wants than to endure the
thought of going without it. In putting the
library where the users are, instead of
where they are not, we are following the
simple rule of trade that meters city property
by the foot instead of by the acre.</p>

<p>The municipal library is a place not for
everything, but for particular needed
things. If it were true that Mark Hopkins
on one end of a log and a student on the
other constituted a college, it is even
more true that a librarian in a bare room,
anxious to serve the public via the public
official and knowing where the material is,
constitutes an infinitely better municipal
reference library than a place perfectly
equipped which suggests erudition rather
than immediate help. There is great danger
that our municipal reference libraries
will become junk shops, as interesting and
as helpful, as out of date or as unrelated
to today's problems as an encyclopedia or a
"compendium of useful knowledge." A municipal
reference library should suggest answers
to today's questions; not answers
either to yesterday's questions or to next
year's. Will you, the librarians, consider
the importance and the advisability of
keeping these libraries workshops, as they
ought to be, and of using your general reference
libraries as the place for the storage
of materials.</p>

<p>The ordinary city official hasn't the time
to plough through a mass of pamphlets
looking for what he wants. He wants the
facts collated and marshalled, ready for
use&mdash;and "he wants what he wants when
he wants it." Some time ago I was interested
in drawing an ordinance to license
all vehicles using the New York streets,
and to regulate the weight, the width and
size of tires, etc., of our great trucks that
have been tearing up our pavements. I
wanted to know about the policy of other
cities in this matter, and to devise, if possible,
a way of making those vehicles that
destroy the streets help pay for their maintenance.
Similarly, today, as Chairman of
the committee on the height, size and
arrangement of buildings within the city
limits, I am interested in the adoption of
some reasonable basis for regulating our
modern skyscraper in order to keep the
city, literally, from choking itself to death.</p>

<p>Again, we have had to restore to the
public many miles of city sidewalks that
had been preempted by stoops, and other
encroachments. We have wanted to plan
our public buildings and related matters
with a view to the future, and to the
grouping of building sites in a "Civic Center."
So, in dealing with our transit problem;
in investigating the health department,
and in improving the type and quality
of street pavements, I have wanted not
all the information there was to be had&mdash;not
books or formal reports&mdash;but concrete
answers to immediately pressing questions.
I wanted to be referred to the latest article
or report which would make it unnecessary
to go through twenty or a hundred other
articles, books or reports. It is enough
to know that in a great central library
are all the working materials for scientific
research. Frankly, I feel that the actual
use that will be made of the municipal
reference library will be in inverse ratio
to the number of books that are in evidence,
and that require the time of the librarian.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>I would go so far as to say that anything
that a public official has not just
called for, or that the librarian is not about
to call to the attention of a public official
for departmental study or report, or for
the drawing of ordinances, should be kept
in the general library, and out of the
municipal reference library.</p>

<p>Comptroller Prendergast and Librarian
Anderson are even planning to have
New York's official correspondence "clear"
through the municipal reference library&mdash;so
far as the writing and answering of letters
calling for special information goes.
I am told that when Portland recently
started its municipal reference library the
mayor promptly availed himself of its
facilities for answering innumerable sets
of questions and special questions that
came from outside the city, and advised
his heads of departments to follow his
example. I wish the Carnegie Institution
for Scientific Research or some other great
foundation interested in the conservation
of national resources and human energy
would investigate what it is now costing
this country to fill out the innumerable
blanks from college boys wishing help on
their commission government debate; college
students writing theses; national organizations
compiling reports, etc. Niagara
unharnessed was wasting much less
power than are we officials, school superintendents,
mayors, and engineers who are
answering such questionnaires. It would
be lamentable enough if we always answered
right; but most of us answer
quite inadequately, and many of us answer
wrong. Last year, a certain national
society wrote me, asking certain questions
about civil service reform. I had had
more or less to do for some years with that
line of public service. My instinct was to
take time from pressing duties to answer
these questions; but a neighbor who had
received a similar set of questions was
thoughtful enough to write to this national
body and suggest that before he answered
he would like to know how many
other New York officials and private agencies
had received the same set of questions.
It appeared then that twenty different
people, including a dozen officials,
had been asked to fill out that blank.
Whereupon it was suggested that instead
of drawing upon twenty people who did
not possess the facts, the investigator
might turn directly to the Civil Service
Commission that did possess the facts,
and there, no doubt, he readily found what
he wanted.</p>

<p>Now, if a municipal reference library
could have served as a clearing house, it
would have been brought to light at once
that one answer would have served the
purpose of twenty, or that one answer, at
least, would have served the purpose of
the dozen official answers. Moreover, just
as the official reports give fresher material
than published books, such correspondence,
manuscript reports of investigating
committees, etc., give fresher material
than published reports.</p>

<p>Such data should be kept properly classified,
available upon call or when the librarian
sees its time for usefulness.</p>

<p>Another practical suggestion I make
from my experience as an official. While
it seems to apply especially to administrative
departments or to private agencies
specializing in certain fields, I really do
not see much prospect of getting it unless
from a municipal reference library or from
the municipal reference activity of a general
library. I refer to an up-to-date
"Poole's" or cumulative index of the passing
subject matter of city government. You
get, the library gets, once a month a list
of all the articles in the principal books.
Why should we not have a list of the advance
steps taken in public affairs? Just
as soon as a few librarians call for such
information, it will become commercially
possible to reduce it. The individual library
can then add to the material the particular
points that are of interest to its own
community.</p>

<p>Similarly, it would be of the greatest
assistance to every city official if the mat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>ters
under his jurisdiction were listed and
material grouped under proper heads. For
example, the president of the Borough of
Manhattan has jurisdiction over the streets
and sidewalks; encroachments and encumbrances;
street vaults and street
signs; the sewer system; the public buildings;
the baths and markets; and the control
of private buildings through the enforcement
of the buildings laws. If information
in regard to what other cities were
doing in all these matters were listed, plus
suggestions and advance steps taken in
these same matters at home, the reference
librarian would be of incalculable help to
that office.</p>

<p>Finally, just a word about the expense
of the municipal reference library. The
amount which it is justified in demanding
will depend naturally upon the service
it renders. The merit of our new segregated
and classified budget is that it
calls for the work needing to be done,
as well as the cost of not having the work
done, and that it shifts attention from the
personality that requests the budget allowance.
A circumscribed program means
circumscribed budget. Frankly, I believe
that extension of program should and must
precede extension of budget. But this
new kind of social work which serves a
community at those points where it is
now least equipped to serve itself, will not
want for financial support when it talks
about the work that should be done&mdash;and
not about itself.</p>

<p>No municipal activity will, in my judgment,
find it easier in the next twenty-five
years to secure adequate financial support
than the municipal reference library
which is not a compendium of knowledge
but a forecaster of service needed and an
ever-present help in time of trouble.</p>

<p>The PRESIDENT: May I express to you,
Mr. McAneny, the thanks of the American
Library Association for your coming and
the assurance that we have profited
greatly from it.</p>

<p>Adjourned.</p>

<h2>SIXTH GENERAL SESSION</h2>


<p class="center">(Saturday morning, June 28, 1913.)</p>

<p>THE PRESIDENT: During the other
sessions of the Conference we have been
considering people&mdash;and books. At this
concluding session the topics on the program
have special reference to books&mdash;and
people. The first paper invites our
interest by its suggestion of the flavor
which old books bring. Miss G. M. WALTON,
of the Michigan State Normal College,
will present this paper.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>THE FRIENDLY BOOK</h2>


<p>It was Mr. Lowell who reminded me
the other day, by quoting Ecclesiasticus
in one of his essays, that we owe the ideal
of the man of leisure to a book of the
Apocrypha wherein we read, "The wisdom
of a learned man cometh by opportunity
of leisure."</p>

<p>Our profession standing as a guarantor
of our wisdom and our learning, I am here
today to bespeak a portion of our large
opportunity of leisure for&mdash;The Friendly
Book.</p>

<p>There is small fear that we librarians
forget the books of power and the books of
knowledge which DeQuincey (the ofttimes
quoted) presses upon all men. And most
of us undoubtedly possess that ardent
zeal for knowledge which filled the soul
of the literal-minded librarian who read
quite seriously (and found therein a working
category for her own improvement)
Lamb's letter to an old gentleman whose
early education had been neglected, where,
among the qualifications of a preceptor,
the following will serve to refresh your
memories: "He must be a thorough master
of vernacular orthography, with an
insight into the accentualities and punctualities
of modern Saxon. He must be competently
instructed in the tetralogy, or
first four rules. He must have a genius
capable in some degree of soaring to the
upper element, to deduce from thence the
not much dissimilar computation of the
cardinal points. He must instruct you in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
numeric and harmonious responses, and he
must be capable of embracing all history,
so as from the countless myriads of individual
men, who have peopled this globe
of earth&mdash;for it is a globe&mdash;by comparison
of their respective births, lives, deaths,
fortunes, conduct, prowess, etc., to pronounce,
and teach you to pronounce, dogmatically
and catechetically, who was the
richest, who was the strongest, who was
the wisest, who was the meekest man that
ever lived; to the facilitation of which solution,
you will readily conceive, a smattering
of biography would in no inconsiderable
degree conduce."</p>

<p>I sometimes question if professions are
not tinged with the culture epoch epidemic.
It is not so very long since we were half
hesitatingly taking a place among the
other learned professions, almost with the
apologetic air of the young boy making
his first appearance in long trousers, and
wondering if his fellow-men appreciate his
coming into their midst&mdash;but the youth
soon assumes the aggressive attitude
which compels attention&mdash;and one symptom
of this attitude which I feel among
ourselves is the large and learned talk
about <b>new</b> books&mdash;the self-satisfied air and
monumental confidence in our sometimes
sophomoric knowledge and understanding
of all things "in the heavens above, the
earth beneath, and the waters under the
earth," until I wonder if the pleasant counsel
about reading "books at least a year
old, that we like, and that are great
books" must be relegated with the rest of
our Emersonian philosophy to the lumber
room of our many youthful joys and
dreamings.</p>

<p>I believe we all love best to mark the
passing years by the friends they bring us,
and it were a barren year that brings not
one more friend, and so with our friendly
books, which like all friendships fill our
lives with genial warmth and gratitude.
Neither is really a matter of choice, for a
book like a person yields its intimate
charm only to the sympathizing heart.
We have no care to answer why, other
than, "because"&mdash;"We love them because
we <b>must</b> love them." A new book friend
comes to us now and then, and we cling to
the old ones. Sometimes we lose the personal
touch, but we see their kindly faces
and after a separation from them we arrange
them on the shelves, and we rearrange
them, and, as Mr. Arnold Bennett
says, "The way we walk up and down in
front of those volumes, whose faces we
have half forgotten, is perfectly infantile."</p>

<p>I remember once in Rome a friend, selecting
photographs, said, "I must take a
good Cicero to my son Frank, who used
to say he felt as well acquainted with Cicero
as he did with Bishop Huntington,"
and dear old Dean Hook, when a lad at Oxford
expresses this same intimate feeling
in one of his lively inimitable letters, "I
have got into a very dissolute set of men,
but they are so pleasant that they make
me very often idle. It consists of one
Tuft, H. R. H., Henry Prince of Wales,
and a gentleman Commoner named Sir
John Falstaff, and several others. I breakfast
with them, drink tea, and sometimes
wine with them," and, again, on hearing
the good news of the recovery of his
grandfather, he writes, "The minute I
opened the letter and saw the news, I
pulled down my Shakespeare and had a very
merry hour with Sir John Falstaff. I was
determined to laugh heartily all that day.
I asked Sir John to wine with me. I decanted
a bottle of my beloved grandfather's
best port and Sir John and I drank
his health right merrily. Perhaps you
will want to know how my old friend Sir
John drank my grandfather's health. Why
I took care to find out the place where he
drank Justice Shallow's health. And so
when I said, 'Here's to Sir Walter,' I
looked on the book and the Knight said,
'Health and long life to him.'"</p>

<p>Among the oldest and dearest of my
friendly books is the "Life and Letters of
Lord Macaulay," of which I became the
happy owner, when it was fresh off the
press, during a sojourn in the west, far
away from my home library. The dates along
the margins (one of Macaulay's habits
which I adopted as I read) bring pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
thoughts of a journey from Colorado to
the western coast, and long before I knew
Dean Hook (whom I first met here as the
Vicar of Leeds) I was pulling Macaulay
down from the shelf, not indeed to drink
with Sir John, but to refer to some particular
talk of men or of books&mdash;always to
read on and on with equal delight whether
he were breakfasting with a party of old
Trinity College friends, reading in his
study, or acting as a guide and escort on
a half holiday of sight-seeing with his
nieces and nephews, with whom he was
always the prince of playfellows. It was
on one of these excursions to the zoological
gardens that Thackeray overheard someone
say, "Never mind the hippopotamus!
Never mind the hippopotamus! There's
Mr. <b>Macaulay</b>!" When absent he exchanged
long and frequent letters with
the children, sealing those to his nephew
at Harrow with an amorphous mass of red
wax, which, in defiance of all postal regulations,
usually covered a piece of gold.</p>

<p>A scrap from one of his letters to a little
niece will serve also as an example of
the poetry, which he usually attributed to
the Judicious poet, for whose collected
works the children vainly searched the
library.</p>

<p>"Michaelmas will, I hope, find us all at
Clapham over a noble goose. Do you remember
the beautiful Puseyette hymn on
Michaelmas day? It is a great favorite
with all the Tractarians. You and Alice
should learn it. It begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Though Quakers scowl and Baptists howl,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though Plymouth Brethren rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We churchmen gay will wallow today<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In apple sauce, onions and sage.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ply knife and fork, and draw the cork,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And have the bottle handy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For each slice of goose we'll introduce<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A thimbleful of brandy.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Is it not good? I wonder who the author
can be? Not Newman, I think. It is above
him. Perhaps it is Bishop Wilberforce."</p>

<p>The Macaulays and the Wilberforces living
at Clapham Common are very real
people to me, and my firm allegiance to
Trinity College, Cambridge, has never
wavered since Macaulay's undergraduate
days, not even when Samuel Wilberforce,
the future bishop, went up to Oriel College,
Oxford.</p>

<p>And how doubly precious is a book-friendship,
whose introduction claims a
personal touch; as when, with the same
friend who bought the photograph in
Rome, I afterwards visited Winchester
Cathedral and standing beside the chantry
tomb of Bishop Wilberforce she said,
"When you go home, read his life. He
was a great and good man," and I have
continued reading it for nearly thirty
years. Wilberforce was undoubtedly for
twenty-five years the greatest figure in the
English Church. His great sorrows made
him tender and tolerant, and many who
saw only the brilliant man little dreamed
of the causes and depth of his power. He
was made Bishop of Oxford in the troublous
times of the Tractarian Movement,
and so great was the work he accomplished
and so devoted to him were his
clergy that when translated to Winchester,
Bishop Stubbs, who succeeded him,
coming from quiet Chester, where his history
was his chief occupation, ruefully
asked, "Why am I like the Witch of Endor?
Because I am tormented by the
spirit of Samuel." His quickness and humor
flashed an unexpected light on many
a question, as when asked why he was
called Soapy Sam he answered it was
probably because he was always in hot
water and always came out with hands
clean. And his whimsical reply to "Who
are the greatest preachers in England?"&mdash;is
one of those comical self-evaluations
which it is generally most hard to give&mdash;"I
must refer you to an article on a lady's
dress&mdash;Hook and I." His absolute freedom
from personal animosity shows itself
in the story I like best of all. During
a stormy committee meeting in which he
and the Bishop of London were violently
opposed to each other, he threw a note
across the table. Supposing it to be some
point on the business in hand, the Bishop
of London read, "My dear Bishop: You
really should not wear such boots. Your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
life is too precious and valuable to us all
to allow such carelessness."</p>

<p>Nothing could more touchingly express
the devoted and loving esteem in which
he was held than these words written at
the time of his death: "With others who
loved him, kneeling reverently beside the
body, was Mr. Gladstone, whose sobs attested
how deeply his feelings were moved
by the sudden loss of his long-tried friend."</p>

<p>The last time I was in England I made a
Sussex pilgrimage to his old home at Lavington.
It was in June, and my companion
smiled as I exclaimed with enthusiasm,
"St. Barnabas day, the eleventh of June&mdash;the
Bishop's wedding day!" We saw
the trees he had planted and loved, the
spot whence he would turn for a last
homeward look, saying he was as proud
of being a Sussex squire as a bishop; and
best of all the great clumps of rhododendron
which he planted with his own hands.</p>

<p>Since so many librarians are gardening
as a favorite recreation, why not have a
friendly corner in the garden, where we
may "Consider the lilies of the field," as
we are bidden in that dearest of all books,
and where each mood, whether gay or
somber, would find echo from the "eternal
passion" of the poets&mdash;"Rosemary for remembrance,
or pray you love, remember
there's pansies, they're for thoughts."
Growing next to these in my own garden is
the fragrant Carolina allspice, because it
was the best loved of flowers by Henry
Bradshaw.</p>

<p>I sometimes question if a book is truly
a friendly book unless I possess it, and yet
this in a way would cut off both Thackeray
and the friend whom he loved best
of all, "dear old Fitz," for I gave away my
"Fitzgerald's Letters" to a friend with
whom I exchange many friendly books. A
man of leisure and literary tastes, and in
easy circumstances, Fitzgerald avoided
fame as earnestly as most men seek it.
Living in a country cottage with a garden,
books, pictures and music, he cherished his
many lifelong friendships, which he says
were more like loves, by writing letters
which have a touch of gentle humor and of
tender and unaffected charm, as in a letter
to Frederick Tennyson: "I have been
through three influenzas; but this is no
wonder, for I live in a hut with walls as
thin as a sixpence, windows that don't
shut, a clay soil safe beneath my feet and a
thatch perforated by lascivious sparrows
over my head. Here I sit, read, smoke and
become wise, and am already quite beyond
earthly things. I must say to you as Basil
Montague once said in perfect charity to
his friends: 'You see my dear fellows, I like
you very much, but I continue to advance,
and you remain where you are, you see,
and so I am obliged to leave you behind.
It is no fault of mine.' You must begin
to read Seneca, whose letters I have been
reading, else you will be no companion to
a man who despises wealth, death, etc.
I wish you were here to smoke a pipe with
me. I play of evenings some of Handel's
grand choruses which are the bravest music
after all."</p>

<p>And again, to William Bodham Donne,
when puzzled over his Agamemnon and
the line of signal fires from Troy to Mycen&aelig;,
he writes, "I am ignorant of geography,
modern and ancient, and do not
know the points of the Beacons, and Lempri&egrave;re,
the only classic at hand, doesn't
help me. Pray turn to the passage and
tell me (quotes three lines of Greek)
what, where and why. The rest I know
or can find in dictionary or map, but for
these:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lempri&egrave;re<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is no-where:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Liddell and Scott<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't help me a jot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I'm off, Donnegan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't help me on again.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So I'm obliged to resort to old Donne
again."</p>

<p>A postscript in a letter to Charles Eliot
Norton reads&mdash;"Only a word, to add that
yesterday came Squire Carlyle from you,
and a kind long letter from Mr. Lowell;
and the first nightingale, who sang in my
garden the same song as in Shakespeare's
days."</p>

<p>And finally, to Lawrence the portrait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
painter: "Have we exchanged a word
about Thackeray since his death? I am
quite surprised to see how I sit moping
about him, so little have I seen him the last
ten years, and not once for the last five.
To be sure I keep reading his 'Newcomes'
of nights and now I have got hold of 'Pendennis.'
I keep hearing him say so much
of it; I really think I shall hear his step
coming up the stairs to this lodging, and
about to come (singing) into my room as
in old Charlotte Street thirty years ago."
And ten years later he writes, "A night
or two ago I was reading old Thackeray's
'Roundabouts,' and (a sign of a good
book) heard him talking to me."</p>

<p>I am sorry that so many people know
Fitzgerald only because of the "Rubaiyat."
I confess myself to be rather like-minded
with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That certain old person of Ham,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who grew weary of Omar Khayyam,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Fitzgerald, said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Is as right as can be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this cult, and these versions,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">O, Damn!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Thackeray, there is no one book
which stands for him, save, perhaps, the
dear little old brown volume of letters to
the Brookfields. It is here that we learn
much of "Pendennis." In one letter he
writes, "I am going to kill Mrs. Pendennis
presently, and have her ill in this number.
Minnie says, 'O Papa, do make her well
again! She can have a regular doctor and
be <b>almost</b> dead, and there will come a nice
homeopathic physician who will make her
well again.'" We who truly know and
love him find him ever in his own pages as
he smiles kindly at us through his spectacles,
or we feel the difficulty with which
he is keeping his spectacles dry, and we
too say, "Dear old Thackeray," as in the
lines at the end of the White Squall, where
with pages of nonsense, he writes how the
Captain</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Beat the storm to laughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For well he knew his vessel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that wind would wrestle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when a wreck we thought her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doomed ourselves to slaughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How gaily he fought her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the hubbub brought her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the tempest caught her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried, George some brandy and water.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when its force expended,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The harmless storm was ended,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the sunrise splendid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came blushing o'er the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought, as day was breaking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My little girls were waking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiling and making<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prayer at home for me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One of these little girls, Minnie Thackeray,
became the wife of Leslie Stephen,
of whom Mr. Lowell speaks as "that most
lovable of men," whose Life and Letters,
so full of rich and wondrous friendships,
and of deep and subtle charm, is always
a midnight companion if taken up in the
evening. While our serious-minded librarian
may find its chief value in the chapter
on "The Struggle with the Dictionary,"
where as editor, I presume many of us
first met with Stephen, (and which would
prove invaluable to Lamb's old gentleman)
she will find there only a small part of the
Real Leslie Stephen, who wrote one day
to Edmund Gosse, "No, R. L. S. is not the
Real Leslie Stephen, but a young Scotchman
whom Colvin has found&mdash;Robert
Louis Stevenson."</p>

<p>It is a temptation to linger over Stephen's
letters to John Morley and Charles
Eliot Norton (perhaps his closest lifelong
friends), and to the rich list of literary
men whom he knew so well through his
long years of literary and editorial work.
Like those of Lowell and Stevenson, his
letters lead one constantly to the reading
of his books, wherein again one always
finds himself. It were difficult to
imagine more felicitous titles of self-revelation
than "Hours in a library," "The
amateur emigrant," and "My study window."
I cannot leave Stephen without a
word from the "Letters to John Richard
Green" (little Johnny Green) which he
edited. As Macaulay used to love to
prove the goods he praised by samples of
quotation, I will content myself with
Green's questioning Freeman, in a long letter
full of Early English history: "By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
way, have you seen Stubb's Hymn on
Froude and Kingsley?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Froude informs the Scottish youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That parsons do not care for truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Reverend Canon Kingsley cries:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">History is a pack of lies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What cause for judgments so malign?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brief reflection solves the mystery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Froude believes Kingsley's a divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Kingsley goes to Froude for history.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Long years ago my eye caught the title,
"From Shakespeare to Pope," Gosse, and as
I took down the book, I asked, "Well, what
was there from Shakespeare to Pope?"&mdash;a
question which the book answered so
delightfully that I read it straight through
twice, while the Critical Kit Kats is my
particular joy in introducing to friendly
books my young student readers, whom
I send off armed with it, together with a
volume of Fitzgerald, or Stevenson, or
the Browning sonnets. Mr. Gosse has
such a comfortable and intimate way of
saying things that makes one feel it is
one's own expression of one's own
thoughts. I suppose most of us own to
a pocket copy of Shakespeare's sonnets,
wherein we have marked many a line, and
then Mr. Gosse writes for us, as he sends
the sonnets to a friend:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This is the holy missal Shakespeare wrote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, on sad evenings when you think of me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or when the morn seems blyth, yet I not near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Open this book, and read, and I shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meter murmuring at your bended ear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot write my love with Shakespeare's art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the same burden weighs upon my heart."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Do your friendly books ever find each
other out upon the shelves? After reading
in Mary Cowden Clarke's "My long
life," of her childish, reverent awe towards
Keats and Shelley, who were often guests
in her father's house, the book found its
place next to those poets, and was it Keats
who was sitting on the sofa when the same
little girl crept up behind and kissed his
hand just because she had heard he was
a poet? Gilbert White's "Natural history
of Selborne," much in the same way stands
beside Lowell, in whose "Garden acquaintance,"
I first learned its "delightful charm
of absolute leisure," and here too, when
it leaves my study table, stands that dear
big book which still claims my leisure
hours, "Charles Eliot, landscape architect,"
one of those rare books with a subtle and
unconscious autobiographic touch, when
one chances upon the fact that the writer
was Harvard's president, telling the story
as the brief fore-note says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"For the dear son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who died in the bright prime&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the father."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But this is all very personal and my only
hope is that while I am reading, you are
following the example of my sometime
youthful nephew, who, on being asked
about the sermon one Sunday after church,
answered, "Why really, Mamma, I don't
know what it was about. I got tired
listening, and withdrew my attention and
went fishing."</p>

<p>Finally, although we are admonished not
to put new wine into old bottles, there
fortunately is no admonition against old
wine in new bottles, and friendliness is
certainly the richest of wine both in men
and in books. Nor am I at all certain that
in the last analysis it is not the supreme
grace which makes possible that joy in
life, without which we are of necessity cast
into a limbo of outer darkness, and so I
commend to you the best of old wine which
ever lingers in The Friendly Book.</p>

<p>THE PRESIDENT: Our good old friend,
Dr. Canfield, once told a story about a
critic who after a life devoted to the gentle
art of making enemies was gathered to his
fathers. Those who had known him, and
who had for the most part been recipients
of his buffetings gathered about his bier,
and compared notes and estimates of the
special qualities which the late departed
had possessed. Yes, said one, "he loved
us so well that he chastised us frequently."
True, said another, "he could never catch
sight of one of us without administering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
a vigorous kick." At this the eyelids of
the deceased were seen to flutter a bit,
and he sat bolt upright and his sepulchral
voice made this response: "Yes, but I
always kicked towards the goal."</p>

<p>Now perhaps this introduction may not
seem to be a very happy preliminary to the
paper about to be announced, and in some
respects its application may not be evident,
for certainly the speaker who is about
to talk to us, on "How to discourage reading"
is by no means a dead one. He has,
however, been somewhat active in the kicking
process&mdash;though always towards the
goal. I present to you Mr. EDMUND L.
PEARSON, of the Boston Transcript.</p>

<p>Mr. PEARSON: The president has very
kindly referred to the fact that while I
do not practice the profession of librarian,
I tell other people how they ought to do
it. He might have made use of a quotation
or a sentence or two at the beginning
of Mark Twain's "Puddin'head Wilson,"
only I fear that Mr. Legler was too
courteous to use it. I have no hesitation
in speaking of it myself. Mark Twain
says of the Puddin'head Wilson maxims:
"These maxims are for the instruction and
moral elevation of youth. To be good is
noble, but to tell others how to be good is
nobler and much less trouble."</p>

<p>Mr. Pearson read the following paper:</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<h2>HOW TO DISCOURAGE READING</h2>


<p>When the "Five Foot Shelf" of books
were published, three of my friends bought
the set. One of them did so without any
pretence that he was going to read them.
He is a somewhat na&iuml;ve young man, able
to indulge his whims, and he said he
thought that buying the books "would help
out President Eliot." That is a very meritorious
sentiment to hold toward the compilers
or authors of books&mdash;I wish that
there were more persons who felt that way.
I have no fault to find with him, at all.</p>

<p>Nor have I any complaint to make
against the other two men. Blame is not
what they deserve, but commiseration.
Like the girl in the song, they are "more
to be pitied than censured." The price
was a consideration with them, and they
gave up their money for the sake of being
forever cut off from all those tremendous
"classics." For that is what it amounted
to. One of these men has a very pretty
office, with some nice bookshelves, painted
white. He added to the books of his profession
and some other works of general
literature, this "Five Foot Shelf"&mdash;which
occupies, I believe, about eighteen feet
of shelf room. He tried to read one of
the books&mdash;I know he did that, because
he admitted it&mdash;and he confided to me
that he thought it was silly.</p>

<p>The third man bought the "Five Foot
Shelf," and announced his determination
"to read the whole thing right through."
He did this with set teeth, as if he might
have said: "I'll read 'em if they kill me!"
Well, he started one of them. He read a
little in Franklin's "Autobiography." I
know he did, because he told me about it.
He and I belong to that irritating class of
persons who get up early and take long
walks before breakfast, and then take care
to mention it later in the day, as if to
cast discredit on other people. We have
to go early, too, because we intersperse
the walks with runs, and he has dignity to
maintain, and it wouldn't do for him to
dash about the streets after other people
are up. While we walked, or dog-trotted,
about the country roads he told me about
the "Autobiography." But I have noticed
that he has left the "Five Foot Shelf." I
doubt if he even finished that first one
of its volumes which he attempted. When
he talks about books now, it is about the
"History of the American people." He
is a Democrat, and like many Democrats
he has discovered that our history has
been truly written only according to Mr.
Woodrow Wilson.</p>

<p>Will any one of those three men ever
read <b>two whole</b> volumes from that set?
It is doubtful&mdash;very doubtful. And their
cases are, I believe, typical of thousands
of others. And what is true of the "Five
Foot Shelf" is true of a score of other
collections&mdash;the Hundred Best Books, the
Greatest Books of the Universe, the Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Ponderous Volumes of the Ages, the Selected
and Highly Recommended Classics
of All Nations. There are dozens of them&mdash;you
all know them&mdash;these "standard"
sets and collections, in which learned and
well-intentioned men have innocently conspired
with publishers to discourage reading.</p>

<p>The "Five Foot Shelf" is not picked out
for especial disapprobation. As a matter
of fact, I suppose it is far better, far more
human in its selections, far more readable
in some of its titles than most of these
sets of "great" books. But there is something
about every one of these collections
of classics that acts like a palsy upon the
reading faculty. It is a little mysterious,
rather hard to define, but that it exists
I have no manner of doubt. It would be
impossible to doubt, after seeing it demonstrated
so many times.</p>

<p>Take, at random, the titles of five famous
books&mdash;books which are apt to turn up
in these sets or collections. Plato's "Republic,"
the "Odyssey," the "Morte D'Arthur,"
the "Anatomy of melancholy," and
"Don Quixote." Take the average man, the
man usually known as the "business" man.
Suppose that he has not read any of these
books in his school days&mdash;that he has
reached the age of forty without reading
them. Now, the chances are at least a
hundred to one that he <b>never</b> reads them.
But let him buy one of the sets of thirty
or forty volumes, in which these five books
are included, and the chances against his
reading any one of the five, instead of
being diminished, are enormously increased.
It is now certainly three hundred
to one that he never reads any of the five
books. There is something benumbing,
something deadening, something stupefying,
to the average man to take into his
house six yards of solid "culture." And
this I believe to be true as a general statement,
in spite of instances which may be
adduced here and there.</p>

<p>But, mind you, if this same man happens
to have his attention called to one
of the books&mdash;especially to either of the
last two, as they are a little nearer the
temper of our time&mdash;and if he gets one
of them, <b>by itself</b>, there is now a fair
probability that he may read at least part
of it. He <b>may</b> even finish it.</p>

<p>If he really wishes to read the so-called
great books let him forever beware of
acquiring one of those overwhelming lumps
of literature&mdash;the publisher's delight and
the book-agent's darling&mdash;known by some
such name as the Colossal Classics of the
World. They breed hypocrites and foster
humbugs. He buys them and <b>thinks</b> he
is going to read them. They look ponderous
and weighty and erudite upon his
shelves&mdash;to the innocent. People exclaim:
"My! What fine books you have!" He
tries to smile a wise smile&mdash;to give the
impression that they are the companions
of his solitude, the consolation of his wakeful
hours. He knows that these people
won't ask if he has ever read any of them.
They are afraid he might come back at
them with: "Oh, yes, of course. Now, how
do <b>you</b> like Milton's 'Areopagitica'?" After
a time he begins to think he <b>has</b> read them&mdash;because
he has looked at the backs, and
started to cut one or two of them. Then
it is all up with him. He never even
tries to read them again. They just stand
there and occasionally make him a little
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Making friends with books, and especially
with those famous books which require
some concentration, is like making
friends with people. You can not do it in
a wholesale, yardstick manner. If they
come into our lives at all, they come
subtly, slowly, one at a time. If a man
should walk into this room saying: "All
my life I have been without friends, I have
decided that I wish to have friends&mdash;I am
going to adopt all of you, every one of
you, as a friend, here and now!"&mdash;you
know how an experiment like that would
succeed. It is the same with books.</p>

<p>In the competition for the best method
to discourage reading, the second prize
should be awarded to that pestilential invention&mdash;the
Complete Works of an author.
There was a publisher&mdash;he still lives&mdash;who
told one of his agents: "Books are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
not made to read; they are made to sell."
He was probably the inventor of that discourager
of reading, the Complete Works.</p>

<p>If one of you wishes to keep a friend in
total ignorance of any writer, there is an
almost certain method&mdash;give him one of
the sets of the Complete Works of that
writer. It is a sure method to kill interest.</p>

<p>As in the case of the collections of classics,
there is something wholesale and
overpowering about such a set. It is thrown
at your head, so to speak, in a chunk, and
you never get over the blow. Imagine the
case of a man who had never read Dickens.
If he is wise, he goes at him one book
at a time, he tests and he tries, and at
the end of a few years he owns eight or
ten books&mdash;well-thumbed books, that have
been read, and that represent pleasure.
But if he listens to the book-agent he contracts
for a yard and a half of Dickens, and
when it comes he gazes in despair at that
rigid row of books&mdash;as unassailable as a
regiment of Prussian grenadiers. That is
the end of all intercourse between him and
Charles Dickens.</p>

<p>"Oh, you might as well have them all,"
says the agent, "you needn't read the ones
you don't like." That is what the waiter
told the man when he brought him a
breakfast-cup full of coffee, after dinner,
instead of a demi-tasse: "You ain't got to
drink all of it."</p>

<p>Miles upon miles of these sets of Complete
Works are sold every year, and from
one end of the land to the other, heads of
families are sinking back comfortably upon
their Morris chairs, and gazing in fatuous
self-satisfaction at their bookcases,
which they have just filled, at one swoop,
with nine yards of the Complete Works of
Scott, Cooper, Dumas, Dickens, and Thackeray.</p>

<p>"Look, Mother, we've got the bookcase
filled up at last!" "Well, I am glad to
see it! It was distressin' to see all those
shelves so empty like."</p>

<p>Will they ever look at them? Never a
look! It is even odds they do not cut
the pages. Now that the noble art of
pressing autumn leaves has gone out&mdash;you
know how it was done, with wax and a
hot flatiron, and then you put them between
the pages of a book&mdash;now that pastime
is forgotten, there isn't one remaining
cause why those pages should ever be
opened. The insides of those books will
be the most secret place in that house
henceforth. Talk about sliding panels and
secret drawers in old writing-desks&mdash;they
are open and conspicuous in comparison.
They will be great for hiding places&mdash;I
think I will write a melodrama and have
the missing will turn up in the fifth act,
sixty years later, hidden between page 1
and page 2 of one of the volumes in somebody's
Complete Works.</p>

<p>For the third place in the list of best
methods to discourage reading there are
two competitors. They are so nearly tied
that it is hard to choose between them.
I am inclined to think that the honor
should be awarded to the custom of setting
up counsels of perfection in the matter
of recommending the so-called "classics"
to possible readers, of saying by word
of mouth, or by printed page: "These
are the great classics, the great books of
the world" and adding, by implication, "If
you don't like them, after making heroic
attempts, then you have been weighed in
the balance and found wanting."</p>

<p>This word "classics" covers a multitude
of nuisances and perplexities. The "classics"
include books which are still alive
with humanity, which are delightful today
to any person who is at all bookish, and
they include books which are so utterly
alien, so far removed from our time, place
and habit of mind, that it is absolutely
absurd to pretend that anyone in this
year and land, except a few, a very few,
specialists, can read them with any pleasure,
or can read them at all, in fact, except
under compulsion.</p>

<p>These lists of the great classics are too
frequently compiled with a cowardly obedience
to tradition. It matters a little what
some great person of a hundred or a thousand
years ago thought about a book&mdash;but
it does not matter much. Recently, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
saw in a book a list of great persons who
had been influenced by this or that book.
Some book or other influenced Madame
de Maintenon&mdash;what of it? Doubtless other
books, far less desirable, influenced her,
too, so what does it prove? The value
of books, as a recent writer has pointed
out, shifts and changes with the changing
years. What may have been truly a great
book a thousand years ago is not necessarily
great today&mdash;no matter how many
famous personages have embalmed it in
their praise, and no matter how many
other personages have praised it, not because
they enjoyed it themselves, but because
the earlier ones did. Such a book
is interesting&mdash;to specialists&mdash;as a milestone
in the history of literature, but it is
not to be forced, however gently, upon the
general reader as a book he "ought" to
read.</p>

<p>Museums of art, like the Louvre, contain
paintings which ignoramuses like myself
look upon with astonishment. Medi&aelig;val
pictures of the most hideous description&mdash;how
came they in the same building with
these other beautiful works of art? Is it
possible that anyone is so silly as to pretend
to admire them? And then the explanation
dawns upon the ignoramus: they
are here to illustrate the development of the
art of painting. This is a museum, as well
as a collection of beautiful things. No
one who is honest pretends to enjoy their
beauty. It is thus with books. A great
collection of books may well contain those
writings which seemed full of meaning to
people two thousand years ago, but they
are not to be held up&mdash;not all of them, at
any rate&mdash;as books which anybody "ought"
to read today. The significance of any
work of literature, however noble, is a
thing to ebb and flow, and finally to vanish
altogether. Professor Barrett Wendell reminded
me once that Shakespeare's plays
and my daily themes would alike, one day,
be dust and atoms in the void of the centuries&mdash;but
I do not think that he meant
unduly to compliment Shakespeare by this
association.</p>

<p>Since it is always better to come down
to tacks in speaking of books, I will mention
some of the classics which have little
significance today. It is always dangerous
to do this&mdash;somebody is sure to hold up his
hand and exclaim: "Why, I like <b>them</b>, very
much," or "I know an old gentleman who
reads <b>that</b>, every night before going to
bed." But I will take the risk, and say
that the Greek and French dramas of the
classic periods are works of literature almost
certain to appear on most of these
lists of Best Books, and that it is almost
sheer humbug to put them there. So few
people can read them, there is so little
reason&mdash;especially in the case of the French
plays&mdash;why anyone <b>should</b> read them, today,
that their inclusion is a pitiful example
of lack of courage. In the matter
of the French drama I speak especially of
Racine and Corneille&mdash;names almost certain
to appear on these lists of the classics.
Someone will relate the story about
Napoleon saying that if Racine (or was it
Corneille?) had lived in his time, he would
have made him a marshal. Then some of
his plays are smugly entered upon the
list. With their stiff, set speeches, their
ridiculous unbosomings of the leading characters
of their "confidantes," they are as
out of place in our life as were their
Caesars, Alexanders, and Pompeys, teetering
about the stage in high-heeled shoes,
ruffles, wigs, and all the rest of the costume
of Louis XIV.</p>

<p>It is good to recommend the classics, but
it must not be forgotten that there are
classics, and classics. There should be
independence, and an ability to look things
in the face, to realize that a change has
come, when it is already here. Why should
the people who deal with books let the
politicians get ahead of them? There is
a bright, clean air blowing through the
nation, and those who worship fusty precedent
are correspondingly unhappy. We
have a president who cares not a rap for
mouldy and senseless traditions&mdash;he has
learned well the lesson taught him by one
of his predecessors. If President Wilson
has the courage to point out that the
final authority on matters of factory legis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>lation
and mine inspection in the year 1913
is not necessarily Thomas Jefferson, is it
not possible for the critics and choosers
of books to understand that Dr. Johnson
and Madame de Maintenon have not uttered
the last word about literature? There
might and should be a "new freedom" of
literary criticism&mdash;not yesterday, nor today,
nor tomorrow, but all the time.</p>

<p>Here is another way to discourage reading.
You can do it by giving a man one
of these over-annotated editions of a book.
I mean a book which has so many footnotes
that the text is crowded right out
of bed; a book in which the editor is so
pleased with himself for discovering that
the father of Lady Hester Somebody (who
is mentioned in the text) was born in
1718 and died in 1789 that he simply has
not the decent manners to keep his useless
knowledge to himself. No; he must tell it
to you, even though he elbows the author&mdash;a
better man than himself&mdash;out of the
way to do it.</p>

<p>One of the best books of its kind&mdash;I
speak under correction&mdash;is George Birkbeck
Hill's edition of Boswell's "Johnson."
It is, I believe, correct, and scholarly; it
certainly represents a vast amount of labor,
and it is "very valuable for reference."
Also it is admirably arranged for driving
a reader away from Boswell forever. It
is positively exasperating to see page after
page on which Boswell occupies two lines
at the top, and Dr. Hill takes up all the
rest of the room. Sometimes he takes up
the whole page! Yet that edition is recommended
to readers by persons who
ought to know better.</p>

<p>Other excellent examples&mdash;I am speaking
only of much-praised books&mdash;are found
in the Furness Variorum editions of Shakespeare.
When one of these volumes appears
it is usually greeted by a chorus of
"Oh's!" and "Ah's!" as when a particularly
gorgeous skyrocket goes up on Fourth of
July night. Such scholarship! Such a
boon to earnest Shakespeareans! Such
labor! Such erudition! Well, a great deal
of that praise is deserved&mdash;each volume
is certainly a tour de force. But I wish
to read you from a review of the latest of
them&mdash;a review written for the Boston
Herald, by Mr. John Macy, the author
of that vigorous and sensible book, "The
spirit of American literature." It deals
with "The tragedie of Julius Caesar" edited
by Horace Howard Furness, Jr. "This,"
writes Mr. Macy, "is the latest volume
in 'A New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare,'
and is the first under the sole
editorship of the late Dr. Furness' son.
From an enormous mass of commentary,
criticism, word-worrying, text-marring and
learned guesswork, Mr. Furness has chosen
what seem to him the best notes. The
sanity of his introduction and the good
sense of some of his own notes lead one
to suppose that he has selected with discrimination
from the notes of others. His
work is a model of patience, industry and
judgment. He plays well in this game of
scholarship. But what is the game worth?
What is the result?</p>

<p>"Here is a volume of nearly 500 large
pages. The text is a literal reprint of the
folio. The clear stream of poetry runs
along the tops of the pages. Under that
is a deposit of textual emendations full
of clam-shells and lost anchors and tin
cans. Under that is a mud bottom two
centuries deep. It consists of (a) what
scholars said Shakespeare said; (b) what
scholars said Shakespeare meant; (c) what
scholars said about what other scholars
said; (d) what scholars said about the
morality and character of the personages,
as (1) they are in Shakespeare's play, and
as (2) they are in other historical and fictitious
writings; (e) what scholars said
about how other people used the words
that Shakespeare used; (f) what scholars
said could be done to Shakespeare's text
to make him a better poet. I have not
read all those notes and I never shall read
them. Life is too short and too interesting.
All the time that I was trying to read the
notes, so that I could know enough about
them to write this article, my mind kept
swimming up out of the mud into that clear
river of text. It is a perfectly clear river.
Some of the obscurities that scholars say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
are there are simply not obscure, except
as poetry ought to have a kind of obscurity
in some turbulent passages. Some of
the obscurities the scholars put there in
their innocence and stupidity, and those
obscurities you can eliminate by blandly
ignoring them."</p>

<p>These learned and over-annotated editions&mdash;they
are not intended, you say, for
the casual reader. Yet they get into his
hand&mdash;they are, sometimes recommended
to him. And, as Mr. Macy asks, are they
worth the labor they have cost&mdash;are they
worth it to <b>anybody</b>? Looking at them
reminds me of the ideal ascetic of the
Middle Ages, St. Simeon Stylites. St. Simeon
was considered the most religious man
of his time because for twenty years he
lived upon a pillar that "numbered forty
cubits from the soil," and because he
would</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tween the spring and downfall of the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bow down one thousand and two hundred times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Christ, the Virgin Mother, and the Saints."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In spite of that, St. Simeon is not the
ideal religious man today. Will these fact-collectors
be the ideal scholars a century
hence?</p>

<p>Are we sometimes acclaiming as great
scholars men who are really doing nothing
but a tremendous amount of grubbing? Are
some of the so-called scholarly editions
really scholarly, or are they simply gigantic
"stunts?" Whatever may be their value
for reference, and that is vastly over-rated,
they discourage reading.</p>

<p>It is also possible to drive people away
from books, or make it difficult for them
to get near books, by printing confusing
things about them. It is possible to catalog
a book&mdash;according to the best rules&mdash;in
such a fashion as to make it an exceedingly
unattractive, not to say repellant object.
This is bad enough when it is done
in the formal catalog, but when it is done
in little leaflets, and book-lists&mdash;things
which ought to be informal and inviting&mdash;the
case is very sad. The other day I
saw an entry in a book-list which read like
this: "Dickens. Whipple, E. P. Charles
Dickens." The expert is in no doubt; the
uninitiated may well be confused to know
which is the author and which the subject.
When someone defends such practices by
saying: "But the rules!" someone else,
whose voice is a voice of authority ought
to say: "Fudge! And also Fiddle-de-dee!"</p>

<p>The general subject today is "the World
of Books." It is a delightful world&mdash;one
so different from that into which we
emerge every morning that it seems hard,
sometimes, to realize that the one exists inside
the other. It is a place of entertainment
within the reach of any of us. There
are a few obstructions around the entrance&mdash;some
of which I have tried to describe.
People have built up walls of impossible
"classics"; publishers have tried to string
a barbed-wire fence of Complete Works
around it. Pedants stand outside, calling
upon you to swallow a couple of gallons
of facts before you go into the great tent.
You can walk by them all. Inside, everything
is pleasant. Over in one corner are
the folk who like to play with first editions,
unique copies, unopened copies, and all the
rest of those expensive toys. Some of
these gentlemen have about as much to
do with the world of books as have the
collectors of four-post beds and old blue
china, but many of them are very good
fellows. Most of them do not belong in
here at all, but, like boys who have crawled
in under the tent, now they are inside
they think they have as much right as
anybody. Some of them, indeed, are quite
uppish and superior, and inclined to look
down on the rest of us who have a vulgar
notion that books are made to <b>read</b>.</p>

<p>Here is all you require&mdash;a comfortable
chair, and a pipe. And the company! Well,
look around:</p>

a library school, yet you have sympathy
with those who have not attained to that
distinction. You have been associated with
a great scientific library, you have been
in charge of a medium-sized library and are
now at the head of the largest public library
in the world; and yet many of us
have had evidences that you have the
deepest and warmest sympathy for the
small and struggling library, no matter
where it may be.</p>

<p>Mr. President-elect, the retiring board of
officers received this gavel not as an emblem
of authority, but as a symbol of service.
As such we commit it to your care
for the next year.</p>

<p>For the retiring board of officers I may
say, in the words of Wynken DeWorde in
one of his colophons, "And now we make
an end. If we have done well, we have
done that which we would have desired;
and if but meanly and slenderly, we yet
have done that which we could attain unto."</p>

<p>The wish goes from the ex-president to
the president that the most successful administration
in the history of the Association
may be the one which is about to
begin.</p>

<p>(Mr. Legler then handed the gavel to
Mr. Anderson and retired from the platform.)</p>

<p>PRESIDENT ANDERSON: Ladies and
gentlemen, fellow members of the Association:
In the first place, I want to express
my heartfelt thanks for the gracious things
the retiring president has just been pleased
to say concerning my humble self. Furthermore,
I have to thank him for giving
me an opportunity to correct a mistake
which has been current in this Association
for some twenty years, namely, that
I am the graduate of a library school. I
was at the Albany library school&mdash;more
years ago than I care to tell&mdash;between
seven and eight months. My money ran
out and I had to get a job. I did not even
complete the first year. That is a reflection
on me, not upon the library school.</p>

<p>The exigencies of trains and luncheons
would make it unfair if not cruel for me
to detain you here this morning with a
speech and I shall make none. But I want
to beg you on this occasion to forget and
forgive the disagreeable things said or
done by the officers-elect in the heat of
a bitter partisan campaign. (Laughter&mdash;There
was no opposition ticket.)</p>

<p>Seriously, I want to express to you all,
not merely for myself but for every member
of the incoming executive board and
the incoming members of the Council, our
appreciation of the honor you have conferred
upon us and of the responsibilities
you have placed upon our shoulders. We
can only hope to maintain&mdash;and it will
require a struggle and great and arduous
work on our part to maintain&mdash;the high
standard set by our predecessors. I thank
you.</p>

<p>If there is nothing further to come before
us the Conference will stand adjourned.</p>

<p>ADJOURNED SINE DIE.</p>

<h2>EXECUTIVE BOARD</h2>


<h3>Meeting of June 23, 1913</h3>

<p>Meeting called to order by President
Legler. Other members present were
Miss Eastman, Messrs. Anderson, Andrews,
Putnam and Wellman.</p>

<p>Several matters of routine business were
transacted, including the reception and
adoption of the report of the Committee
on Nominations.</p>

<p>Upon motion of Mr. Anderson, seconded
by Dr. Putnam, Mrs. H. L. Elmendorf was
elected member of the Publishing Board
to succeed herself for a term of three
years.</p>

<p>In behalf of the Committee on International
Relations, Dr. Putnam reported that
with such information as it had been able
to gather the committee felt unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
make any affirmative recommendation as
to participation by the American Library
Association in the proposed Exposition of
the Book and Graphic Arts at Leipzig in
1914.</p>

<p>Adjourned.</p>


<p class="center">Meeting of June 28th</p>

<p>Present: President Anderson, Miss
Eastman, Messrs. Andrews, Wellman and
Craver.</p>

<p>Mr. Wellman presented his resignation
as non-official member in view of his election
to the office of first vice-president,
which, upon motion of Dr. Andrews, was
accepted.</p>

<p>Upon motion of Mr. Craver, it was unanimously
voted that W. N. C. Carlton be
elected to the Executive Board to fill the
unexpired term of Mr. Wellman. Mr. Carlton
was called to the meeting and took his
place as a member of the Board.</p>

<p>A meeting place for 1914 was next considered.
Miss Edith A. Phelps, librarian
of the Carnegie library of Oklahoma City,
appeared before the board and invited the
Association to meet in Oklahoma City, her
invitation being seconded by the Oklahoma
Library Association and other organizations
of the State. Invitations were
received also by letter from the convention
bureaus of New Orleans, Nashville, Wilmington,
Del., Milwaukee, and other
places. After informal discussion it was
voted that the Secretary be instructed to
investigate facilities for holding the conference
at Madison, Wis., and if, in the
opinion of the president and secretary,
conditions at Madison are not favorable
for a meeting, that Mackinac and Ottawa
Beach be investigated in the order here
named.</p>

<p>Invitations from the authorities of the
Panama-Pacific Exposition to hold the conference
at San Francisco in 1915 were read
and from the California Library Association
to the same effect, Mr. Everett R.
Perry, of Los Angeles, bearing the invitation
from the latter association. Invitations
were also received from the library
authorities of Seattle, seconded by the
business organizations of that city and by
the convention bureaus of other cities of
the Pacific Northwest. It was voted to refer
this information to the next Executive
Board.</p>

<p>Mr. William Stetson Merrill presented
the following report in behalf of the Committee
on code for classifiers, which, upon
motion, was accepted as a report of progress,
and the request for an appropriation
of $20 referred to the meeting of the Executive
Board in January.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Committee on code for classifiers
begs to present a report of progress.</p>

<p>During the past year no general meeting
of the Committee has been held, but
the chairman has been in correspondence
with several members of the Committee
and considerable data have been collected
for the proposed Manual for classifiers.
Messrs. Bay and Merrill are more immediately
concerned with this section of the
work and over three hundred points have
been assembled for future consideration.</p>

<p>An appropriation of twenty dollars
($20.00) to cover typewriting, postage and
stationery is requested.</p>

<p class="center">Respectfully submitted,<br />
(Signed)</p>

</div>

<p>At the request of the secretary a transfer
of funds was authorized as follows:
From the contingency fund to conference
fund, $75, and to miscellaneous fund $75,
leaving a balance in the contingency fund
of $95.</p>

<p>Upon motion of Dr. Andrews, it was
voted that members joining the Association
after the annual conference shall
only be required to pay one-half year's
dues together with the usual initiation fee
of $1.</p>

<p>Consideration of the question of issuing
the annual handbook in biographical section
form was postponed until the next
meeting of the Executive Board.</p>

<p>A letter was read from Dr. Frank P.
Hill, suggesting that a special committee
be appointed to consider the matter of participating
in the proposed Leipzig Exposition
and to ascertain the cost of such participation
as well as the possibility of securing
a creditable exhibit from American
libraries. It was voted that a special committee
of three on this subject be ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>pointed
by the president, which committee
shall make the report to the Committee on
international relations. The president appointed
as this committee Dr. Hill with
power to add the other two members.</p>

<p>It was unanimously voted that an appropriation
of $30 from the contingency fund
be made to each of the three members of
the Travel Committee as partial compensation
for expenses incurred in the performance
of association duties, and that
the thanks of the Executive Board be expressed
with regret that the finances of
the Association did not permit a complete
reimbursement of expenses.</p>

<p>A report was submitted from the Committee
on cost and method of cataloging,
but owing to the lack of time for proper
consideration the secretary was instructed
to have the report typewritten and copies
sent to the respective members of the Executive
Board. At the request of the Committee
that two other members be added
to the Committee, one of them to be located
in Chicago, the other to be the head
cataloger of one of the public libraries taking
part in the investigation, the president
appointed the following persons: J. C. M.
Hanson and Margaret Mann.</p>

<p>The request of the Committee for an
appropriation of not to exceed $50 was referred
to the January meeting of the Executive
Board.</p>

<p>The report is as follows:</p>


<h3>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
COST AND METHOD OF
CATALOGING</h3>

<p>The present report is preliminary only.
Before a final report can be made a more
detailed inquiry must be undertaken of
the way in which the work is handled in
libraries of various types. The methods
used in the libraries that have taken part
in the present investigation vary to a considerable
degree, and do not always seem
to lend themselves to an accurate classification
by character or size of library; in
some cases this is possible, for instance
when we find that the receipt of much
duplicate material in the large public libraries
having extensive systems of branch
libraries has developed a method of handling
these that is almost uniform for all.
One element which disturbs the cataloging
work in these libraries is that the withdrawal
and cancellation of the records of
lost and worn-out books is done by the
cataloging departments. Five of the twenty
libraries do not at present readily lend
themselves to comparison in all respects
with the others, the Library of Congress
and the New York public library on account
of their size and complicated organization,
the libraries of Harvard University
and the University of Chicago because
of the disturbances caused by present work
of reorganization and recataloging, and
the New York state library on account
of its rapid growth since the fire two years
ago. In other libraries recataloging goes
on simultaneously with the current work,
but it does not cause the same disturbances
as in the cases mentioned.</p>

<p>While most libraries count classification
and shelf-listing as parts of the cataloging,
only four include accessioning, and three
do not include either of the four processes
mentioned under point 2 in the
questionnaire sent out by the committee.
Three libraries state expressly that the assignment
of subject headings is done by
the cataloging force, but this is probably
also the case with some who do not mention
the fact. In one case the reference
and cataloging work are combined in one
department; in general, reference work
seems to be the catalogers' favorite side
line.</p>

<p>In some libraries the determination of
headings and the form of entry is determined
by the heads of the department, in
others all the original work is done by the
assistants and afterwards revised, while
in at least one case such work as classification
and the assignment of subject headings
is done by specialists, each handling
his particular subject. Two or three libraries
employ a special assistant for the
cataloging of serial publications. Two libraries
have all statistical recording done
by a special assistant or clerk.</p>

<p>Whether a library prints its cards or has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
them written or typewritten in several
copies, does not seem to influence the
method of work except at the final point,
but the growing use of cards printed by
some other library has introduced an element
that did not exist when any of the
libraries taking part in the investigation
were organized.</p>

<p>The cost of cataloging can not be determined
until a definite unit has been agreed
upon. The way to reach such agreement
might be in line with the method employed
by the Boston public library, where a considerable
number of volumes were set
aside for this investigation and the time
and money spent on each work carefully
computed. By employing a similar way
of investigating not only the cost, but also
the routine gone through with a book in
a number of libraries on its way from the
unpacking room to the shelves, some definite
unit might be found.</p>

<p>The work of the committee has only
begun; it should be planned to go much
more into details than the present questionnaire
indicates. The purpose of the
committee should be twofold; to find out
whether a method of handling the routine
with a minimum expenditure of time could
be worked out that could be recommended
as standard, and to study how the work
might be so arranged as to be made in
some degree less mechanical to those who
are capable of more or less independent
handling of literary material for the purpose
of preparing it for use by readers in
libraries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Bostwick as chairman presented the
following:</p>


<h3>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RELATIONS
BETWEEN THE LIBRARY
AND THE MUNICIPALITY</h3>

<p>In presenting this final report, your Committee
finds it necessary to consider and
to give expression to two points of view,
both of which are represented in its membership
and neither of which can be neglected&mdash;one
that believes that, owing to
diversity of local conditions and of constitutional
and other requirements in different
parts of the Union, it is impossible
to frame definitely a model library law
or a model library section of a city charter,
and the other, that without some such
expression as can be given only in the
form of a definite body of law of this kind,
the recommendations of the Committee
will necessarily be vague and will largely
fail of effect.</p>

<p>Your committee has therefore thought
it best in the first place to make a statement
of the things that a library law or
charter section should, in its opinion, aim
to do, giving reasons where necessary;
and in the second place to present a definite
example of the way in which these
things may be done, accompanied by a
warning that before adopting it as a model
in any specific instance, it should be
carefully studied by some competent person
and modified to suit the necessities of
the case. Your committee realizes also
that every state library law should contain
provisions, such as those regulating
the State Library and Library Commission,
which do not fall within the duties assigned
to this committee and hence are
not touched upon in this report.</p>

<p>And first, regarding the aims of a library
law:</p>

<p>(a) We reiterate our statement of last
year that the library is an educational
institution and that education is a matter
of state rather than of local concern. If
a state already has a good library law
which has worked and is working well and
satisfactorily to all concerned, local libraries
should be left in operation under
the provisions of the law, precisely as the
schools should be and generally are left,
no matter what changes in the form of
municipal government are contemplated
or have been carried into effect. If the
state law is not entirely satisfactory, it is
better to amend it than to try to better
matters through the local charter. The
charter may well contain, to avoid the possibility
of conflict, some such special disclaimer
as the following: "Nothing in this
charter shall be so construed as to interfere
with the operation of the public library
under the library laws of the state."
If the library law contains provisions seemingly
in conflict with new charter provisions,
some additional definition may be
necessary.</p>

<p>(b) Possibly we are not yet ready for
compulsory library establishment throughout
a state, but at all events it should be
made simple and easy for any public taxing
or governing body to establish a free
public library and to tax itself for the
support of that library, accepting gifts
where necessary and obligating itself to
fulfill the conditions under which these
gifts are made. This would include municipalities,
counties, townships, school districts,
boards of education, etc.</p>

<p>The library should be assured of reasonable
and sufficient financial support, either
through the operation of a special-tax provision
or by the requirement of a minimum
appropriation by the authorities. In no
case should the existence or value of the
library be placed in jeopardy by making
possible a capricious withdrawal or lessening
of support by the local authorities.</p>

<p>(c) The library should be administered
by an independent board of trustees, not
by a single commissioner, and, in particular,
not by a commissioner who has other
matters on his hands. In case such grouping
appears necessary, the library should
be placed with other educational agencies
and in no case treated as a group of
buildings or a mere agency of recreation.
The board should be a body corporate, distinct
from other municipal organizations
and departments, with powers of succession,
power to sue and be sued, to acquire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
and hold property, etc. The terms of its
members should not expire all at once, so
that reasonable continuity in policy will be
insured. It should have power to take
over and manage other city libraries,
school libraries and, by contract, libraries
in other municipalities or communities.</p>

<p>(d) The funds of the library, including
those derived from taxation, bequest, gift,
and library fines and desk receipts, should
be at the board's free disposal for library
purposes, including the purchase of land
and the erection of buildings. They should
be received and held by the municipal authorities,
and disbursed on voucher, with
the same safeguards and under the same
auspices as those required for other public
funds.</p>

<p>(e) The library should be operated on
the merit system, in the same way that
the schools are so operated&mdash;not by placing
the selection and promotion of library
employees in the hands of the same board
that selects clerks and mechanics for the
city departments, but by requiring that
the library board establish and carry out
an efficient system of service satisfactory
to the proper authorities.</p>

<p>The board should have entire control of
its own working force and should initiate
its own policies, including selection of
sites and planning of buildings, its librarian
being regarded both as its executive
officer and as its expert adviser, to whom
the choice of methods and the management
of details are naturally left. He
should be present at meetings of the board
and may serve as its secretary.</p>

<p>We regard as satisfactory any body of
law that will accomplish the results aimed
at in the following sections, which your
committee does not regard as couched in
legal phraseology. Before being used in
any state its provisions should be worded
by a competent person experienced in
drafting bills for the legislature of that
state.</p>


<h4>Section 1</h4>

<p>Any taxing body shall have authority to
levy a tax, not less than &mdash;&mdash; mills on
the dollar, for the support of a free public
library within its jurisdiction, and such
tax shall be levied if so ordered by a majority
vote of all voters at a general election,
on petition signed by &mdash;&mdash; voters.</p>

<p>Any governing or taxing body shall have
power to provide, by annual appropriation,
for the support of a free public library,
whether or not a tax is levied as above
provided, or to enter into a contract for
library service with another governing or
taxing body or with a private corporation
already maintaining such a library.</p>


<h4>Section 2</h4>

<p>Any library supported as specified in
Section 1 shall be governed by a board of
not less than five or more than nine trustees
(appointed as the legislature may provide),
which board shall have the powers
of a public corporation and shall perform
all acts necessary and convenient for the
maintenance and operation of the library.</p>

<p>The board may receive gifts and bequests,
acquire and transfer property, real
and personal, sue and be sued. It shall
manage all libraries owned by the city
and may contract with other public bodies
within and without the city, to render library
service, adding to its number, if
mutually so agreed, one or more representatives
of such public body. The terms
of the members shall not expire coincidently.
Any member may be removed by
the appointing or elective power for stated
cause.</p>


<h4>Section 3</h4>

<p>All moneys collected for the use of the
library, whether by taxation or otherwise,
shall be in custody of the city treasurer
and shall be paid out by him on vouchers
duly attested by the board and audited
by the proper city authority.</p>


<h4>Section 4</h4>

<p>All employees of the library shall be
appointed and promoted for merit only,
and the board shall adopt such measures
as will in its judgment conduce to this
end.</p>


<h4>Section 5</h4>

<p>If a gift is offered to the library on conditions
involving the performance of cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>tain
acts annually, the municipality may
obligate itself to perform such acts, by
ordinance which shall not be repealed.</p>


<h4>Section 6</h4>

<p>The Board shall submit an annual report
of its work in detail, with its receipts and
expenditures, to the tax-levying body.</p>

<p>Upon motion by Mr. Wellman it was voted
that the above report be printed as a
tentative report in the Bulletin.</p>

<p>Upon motion of Dr. Bostwick it was
unanimously voted that the session of the
Council on Thursday evening, June 26th,
at which the topic, "The Quality of Fiction"
is to be discussed, be thrown open
to the members of the Association at large.</p>

<p>The Chairman called attention to the
vote of the Council which was passed at
the Asheville meeting in 1907, providing
that privilege be given to members of the
Council to reserve hotel rooms at the annual
conferences in advance of the membership
at large and stated that a number
of members of the Association considered
this action as undemocratic and as undesirable
for the Council to continue.</p>

<p>Upon the motion of Mr. Thomson it
was unanimously voted that this ruling
be rescinded.</p>

<p>The following persons were appointed
by the Chair as a Committee on nominations
to nominate five members for the
Council to be elected by the Council for a
term of five years each: H. G. Wadlin,
Josephine A. Rathbone, M. S. Dudgeon,
Edith Tobitt, W. O. Carson.</p>

<p>Mr. Ranck presented a report of progress
in behalf of the Committee on ventilation
and lighting of library buildings and
recommended that the Committee be continued,
which recommendation, upon motion
of Dr. Putnam, was adopted.</p>

<p>The report here follows:</p>


<h4>Report of Committee on Ventilation and
Lighting</h4>

<p class="right">June, 1913.</p>

<p>To the Council of the A. L. A.:</p>

<p>Your special committee on ventilation
and lighting can submit at this time only
another report of progress.</p>

<p>After the meeting at Ottawa the matter
of having laboratory and other tests made
in connection with the technical and scientific
problems was taken up with certain
industrial organizations with a view to the
possibility of having them, in the interest
of scientific knowledge, make the necessary
tests for us, at no expense to the Association.
Objection developed against
this line of procedure, inasmuch as it was
feared that less confidence could be placed
in such tests when the organization making
them (or if the persons making them
were in the service of such an organization)
had a commercial interest in the results
of the tests.</p>

<p>Accordingly the effort was made to have
the tests made by the Carnegie Institution
of Washington, and also by the Russell
Sage Foundation, both of which efforts
failed. The matter was then taken up with
the Department of Commerce, and we are
hopeful that we may be successful in getting
the national government to make
these tests for us through the Bureau of
Standards.</p>

<p>In the meantime the committee is continuing
its investigations and experiments
so far as the limited resources at its command
will permit. In this further study
the committee is strengthened in its belief
reported a year ago to the effect that most
of the ventilating apparatus now in use
will have to be discarded as junk and that
the whole art and practice of artificial ventilation
will have to be entirely remodeled
on a correct physiological basis, inasmuch
as the present basis appears to be entirely
incorrect.</p>

<p>We therefore recommend that the committee
be continued for another year. If
deemed advisable the committee could prepare
a preliminary report of its findings
for publication in the Bulletin of the Association.
Such a report might be of immediate
service to librarians.</p>

<p>As an indication of the committee's difficulties
in this matter we may cite the experience
of Prof. Brooks of the University<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
of Illinois who, after years of study and
experience in illumination, feels less willing
today to prescribe a lighting scheme
than a few years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Ranck made an informal statement
regarding the irregular and unsatisfactory
fire insurance rates which he had found
many libraries of the United States were
securing and recommended that this subject
be investigated by the Council.</p>

<p>It was voted upon motion by Mr. Thomson
that a committee of three be appointed
by the chair to investigate the subject of
fire insurance for libraries. The chair appointed
as this committee M. S. Dudgeon,
Chalmers Hadley and S. H. Ranck.</p>

<p>There being no further business the
Council adjourned.</p>


<h4>Meeting of June 26th</h4>

<p>This session of the Council was conducted
as an open meeting and was attended
by many of the members of the Association
at large. The president presided.</p>

<p>The nominating committee presented the
names of Willis H. Kerr, Mary W. Plummer,
Mary E. Robbins, John Thomson and
Samuel H. Ranck for members of the
Council for a term of five years each. Upon
motion by Dr. Bostwick it was voted
that the secretary cast a ballot for the
election of these members, which was
accordingly done.</p>

<p>The remainder of the session was devoted
to a discussion of "The Quality of
fiction," discussion being led by Dr. Horace
G. Wadlin and Dr. Arthur E. Bostwick.</p>

<p>Dr. Wadlin spoke as follows:</p>


<h4>The Quality of Fiction&mdash;I.</h4>

<p>The question set for our discussion is
not new. It seems to be always with us.
By itself, I do not think it of much importance.
It only becomes so as related to
the much larger question of the general
purpose of the public library&mdash;what it is
supposed to stand for in the community.
All details of library policy revert to that,
and the fiction question is, after all, a detail.</p>

<p>"The quality of fiction"&mdash;if I may paraphrase
the words of a celebrated writer
of it whose works still compete with the
latest "best seller"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The quality of fiction is not strained.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It droppeth like the gentle rain from Heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is, perhaps, thrice blessed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It blesseth him that writes, and him that prints and sometimes him that reads.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis mightiest in the mighty and&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But I refrain from going farther. Beyond
that point we reach debatable ground
and I shall add nothing to the sum of human
knowledge in that direction.</p>

<p>When your President asked me to open
this discussion, he was kind enough to imply
that the time had arrived when representatives
of the larger libraries, at least,
might speak with conviction on this question.
And I suppose I was selected for the
reason that the library for which I am
responsible has, through circumstances not
entirely within its control, acquired a reputation
for ultra-conservatism in respect to
purchases of fiction; a reputation for
which it is entitled to little praise, if the
result be thought meritorious and for
which it should not be blamed if the results
are condemned.</p>

<p>For it is well, always, to choose the
good rather than evil in any line of action;
to choose it, that is, because you love it.
But, if you don't love it, it is fortunate that
in the general plan of nature the good so
surrounds us and hems us in, to say nothing
of the consequences which follow the
choice of evil, that, in any case, we can
scarcely escape the choice of good.</p>

<p>With us in Boston, and I take it the conditions
are not dissimilar elsewhere, the
practical considerations of providing shelf-room
for new accessions, of keeping the
catalog within reasonable limits, the adequate
provision for new books in other departments
of literature, the constant in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>crease
in our fixed charges due to the expansion
of our work&mdash;these enforce the
restriction of purchases of fiction within
limits that may be deemed conservative,
whether we particularly favor conservatism
or not.</p>

<p>Therefore I speak with no pride of opinion
based upon the policy of my own library,
nor in criticism of the policy of others,
nor with any hope of establishing a
hard and fast rule. Criticism is frequently
caustic and bitter. I would fain be persuasive
and kindly. It is indeed my conviction
that no invariable rule is possible on
this matter or on other points of library
policy. Certain principles hold, but the
application of them must vary in different
libraries, and must proceed in harmony
with local environment. Any other course
would result in a system, hard and mechanical,
where it ought to be flexible, sympathetic
and humane.</p>

<p>It is said that in some places it is necessary
to placate public opinion by liberal
purchases of light and harmless trifles,
"bright and snappy" stories, "big heart-gripping"
tales of the moment in order
that the fountain whereon the library depends
for its continued life may not run
dry. If that be so, who am I that I should
sit in the seat of the scornful, or pronounce
judgment on my neighbor? Any librarian
whose hand is thus forced has trouble
enough without my adding to it with wild
and whirling words. After all, such action is
not without precedent&mdash;nay, we may go
farther and say not without justification.
Old Isaac Walton was not the first who
angled successfully with a concealed hook,
and he has his disciples in other than
green pastures or beside still waters. But,
speaking seriously, such bids for the popular
approval that may result in enlarged
appropriations have nothing to do with
the quality of fiction, and carry no lesson
for those in more fortunate circumstances,
who are able to exercise a sane and untrammelled
judgment.</p>

<p>Let us admit freely, that fiction as a
branch of literature, is today important,
not merely as a means of relaxation and
amusement but of inspiration and instruction.
Whether or not that admission implies
that a public library ought to provide
an undue quantity of it is a question
of logic, and to be logical when sentiment
will more effectively carry your point is
today fatal in the discussion of more
weighty matters than the one we are now
considering. There is, indeed, a form of
printed matter even more frequently used
than the novel for relaxation and amusement.
I allude to that required in the
great game of Auction Bridge, and one
may gain instruction, perhaps inspiration
from that, but public libraries so far ignore
it. Although it has been suggested
that a moving-picture annex, freely used
by some millions to the same ends, might
be profitably taken on, and unquestionably
the suggestion has much to recommend it.
At all events, that time may not be wasted
in profitless controversy, I grant, at the
outset, all that the most ardent advocates
of fiction claim in its behalf.</p>

<p>And since it is asserted that many persons
will read nothing but fiction, and that
such reading is especially adapted to put
new life into the tired shop-girl, to illuminate
the social gloom that shrouds the
proletariat, by taking him into worlds as
unlike his real world as it is possible to
make them, and to put a little more vitality
into the merchant overwrought by too
strenuous pursuit of the elusive dollar, why
question its importance as at once a tonic
and a sedative, a general promoter of
bright days and peaceful dreams?</p>

<p>Of course, though many think otherwise,
it is not undeniably the business of a public
library to act as a pharmaceutical dispensatory
and to make persons read who
might much better get a required physical
stimulus in some other way. Mr. Dana
some months ago put the reading of the
classics into the limbo of out-worn tradition&mdash;put
them perpetually "on the blink,"
if I may use language similar to that employed
in fiction by Sewall Ford's popular
hero&mdash;and Miss Corinne Bacon, in a
brilliant paper which, if you have not read
it, I commend to your attention, keenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
reminds Mr. Dana that it is not really necessary
for any of us to read at all.</p>

<p>If, however, we dispute the unqualified
benefits of fiction reading, it is the
works of the masters which are used to
overwhelm us&mdash;the recognized standard
novels, quite modern some of them, for
the production of good fiction did not stop
with the death of Scott or Thackeray or
Dickens&mdash;as if anybody questioned their
influence or their power!</p>

<p>If I wished, on the other hand, to assume
the r&ocirc;le of Mrs. Partington, and seek
to beat back the on-rushing tide of printed
matter, all of which claims to be imaginative
and romantic, I should need no
better broom with which to attempt that
forlorn and hopeless task than one made
from the strands which Mr. Booth Tarkington,
and others actively engaged in the
production of fiction, supplied in the letters
read from this platform Monday evening.</p>

<p>There is a trinity of things, frequently
asserted, which I do not believe, that is, I
do not believe them in my present state of
mental development, though I trust I am
still open to conviction.</p>

<p><b>First</b>, I do not believe that everybody is
entitled to receive at our hands the books
they want, when they want them! I hear
it put this way: The State or the municipality
ought to provide any citizen who
wants a book with the book he wants
when he wants it.&mdash;A moment's candid examination
will, I think, show that this is
impossible, and it being impossible, we
need not spend time in disputing the
theory.</p>

<p><b>Second</b>, I do not believe that we should
buy the book of the day, and all the books
of the day, irrespective of merit; or, as a
critical journal once put it, "Buy the books
the world is talking about&mdash;merit or demerit
cast entirely aside."</p>

<p>The talk of the people, about the books
of the day is, 99 per cent of it, if we may
apply a quantitive measure to that which
is immeasurable, pure gossip, fostered by
more or less interested, or paid notices
in the newspapers, and the reading of
books which for the moment are made the
subjects of such gossip is of about as much
real value to the average man or woman
as was Mrs. A's inquiry after the health
of Mrs. B's old man. Not that she cared
anything about his health but the inquiry
helped conversation. And when the book
of the day rises above the plane of mere
gossip its interest or value is frequently
momentary. Two years ago, the cheerful
idlers on summer hotel verandas were
lightening the burden of persistent application
to what, for want of a better term,
is called "fancy work" by reading "The
rosary." Last year, their affections were
centered on "The harvester." This year&mdash;well,
I refrain from advertising what is
likely to be found there.</p>

<p>But surely most public libraries in these
days of expanding opportunity, find it difficult
enough to supply things which have
higher civic promise in them, even in fiction,
without stocking up extensively with
that which is as evanescent as the foam
on the wave.</p>

<p><b>Third</b>, I do not believe&mdash;as some do&mdash;that
the indiscriminate reading of fiction, even
poor fiction, leads finally to the selection
of better books. Once I thought so, and I
know that my distinguished predecessor,
Dr. Winsor, held that opinion. But, after
some thirty years' intimate knowledge of
a library (outside of Boston), not too large
to permit the study of the peculiarities of
individual readers, this seems to me delusive.
If I wanted to promote good reading,
I would not treat it as a pill to be
sugar-coated. Good wine needs no bush.</p>

<p>Passing from the triad of things I do not
believe I make one positive affirmation.
Every public library should establish a
standard. As a matter of fact, this is done
now. For example, the works of Mr.
Charles Garvice are seldom found on our
catalogs nor those of Rev. Silas K. Hocking.
These two among the most popular
English novelists of our day, may be found
on the shelves of the circulating libraries,
and with several others almost equally
well-known, appear among the miscellaneous
attractions of the railway news counters;
but not with us. Why? They are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
clean, highly moral, in the accepted use
of that word, and not without a certain
literary merit. The answer to my query
implies selection, in accordance with a
standard.</p>

<p>I said some years ago on this subject,
and have seen no reason to change my
opinion, that while there are those who
resent what they call "censorship" on the
part of public libraries, nevertheless, simply
because we are public institutions, we
have responsibilities to the public, toward
children, at least, and toward those of
unformed literary taste.</p>

<p>Personally, I am not much afraid of the
baleful effect of certain books usually condemned
by moralists. Not every one who
reads "The pirate's own book" will take
to piracy on the high seas; and a quiet
elderly lady of my acquaintance who reads
rather more erotic French fiction than
some would approve, still preserves, so far
as I can see, modesty of demeanor, and,
unless skilfully dissembled, an exemplary
private life. I was myself, in my young
days a persistent reader of Beadle's dime
novels, which were of size to be readily
concealed between Euclid and Andrews
and Stoddard's Latin Grammar, well out
of view of the censor. Oliver Optic was
permitted to corrupt my young mind, and
since I had an eclectic taste, I absorbed
liberal doses of Sylvanus Cobb, Jr., Emerson
Bennett, and Mrs. Southworth, writers
almost unknown to the present generation.
So far, I have escaped the penitentiary
and the home for feebleminded. But that
does not justify the exposure of Burton's
"Arabian nights" on open shelves, for
which lapse of judgment we were once criticised
by a reputable Boston paper, or
prove that since life is short and art is long
and one can not read everything, and some
books are, from any point of view, better
than others, judicious selection may not
prevent lamentable waste of time.</p>

<p>Before selection is attempted, the
amount available for expenditure should be
fixed, and this should be determined by
the income of the library and the proper
relation which, within that income, purchases
of fiction should bear to other necessary
expenses. The percentage will
vary, I should suppose, with different libraries.
Speaking for my own, it has by experience
been determined at from 20 to
25 per cent of all expenditures for books.
In a recent lean year, it dropped as low
as 12 per cent, but in the last four years
has ranged from 23 in 1912 to 25 in 1909. I
include expenditures for replacements as
well as for new fiction.</p>

<p>All theory apart, no more could have
been spent without impairing the up-keep
of other departments. As I have intimated,
we are always confronted, to use
Mr. Cleveland's phrase, by conditions
rather than theories. I need not enlarge
upon the character of those other departments.
They are not for the use of the
dilettante or the connoisseur. Contrary to
an opinion that seems to prevail in certain
quarters, we do not buy extensively, as one
critical commentator put it, either "musty
parchments or rare first editions in which
not one person in 50 has the slightest interest
or concern."</p>

<p>No. These departments provide for the
scholarly use of a library which is at the
center of a group of educational institutions
accommodating probably 10,000 students.
It is unthinkable to suppose that
this work of education, of so much importance
to our city, could go on without the
aid derived from the library. And I need
only mention the various special collections
which have grown up from the beginning,
which are drawn upon each year by
students who come to us from abroad, and
from which, on the interlibrary loan plan,
we lend annually to other libraries in the
proportion of 1,200 to the 50 which we receive
from them in return.</p>

<p>These phases of our work must be taken
into account, just as similar considerations
must be influential in any library, if a
proper balance is to be kept of expenditures
for fiction. And bear in mind that
every dollar spent for fiction beyond the
proper limit as set by a candid consideration
of conditions and resources, no matter
how insistent the demand&mdash;and it is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
known that the demand may be so insistent
as to require, without satisfying it, all
the money at your command&mdash;every dollar
beyond this limit is a dollar drawn
from students, from readers in courses,
from work with the immigrant, if you have
that problem, from work with children,
from the artisan or mechanic who comes
to you for the books that will add to his
industrial efficiency, from your business
men's branch, if one exists. The library
cannot be made a mere depository for
fiction. This should go without saying.
It does not propose to include all good
fiction in its purchases. The sum set
apart can not all be used for new fiction,
but must cover replacements. The library
must also buy fiction in other languages
than English.</p>

<p>As to the work of selection, I pass in
rapid review our own methods, concerning
which much nonsense has been written.
We examine with care substantially every
book in English that comes from the press,
which any public library is likely to buy.
Last year, which is perhaps typical, 890
different books in fiction were considered,
including fiction for young readers. And
every book was not merely examined by
title, but was read and commented upon
in our interest by at least 3 persons on the
average.</p>

<p>Of course, no such thorough examination
could be made by the library staff
alone, and we have the services of a volunteer
committee of readers not officially
connected with the library. The committee
does not supersede the critical opinion
of the librarian or his selected staff
officers. It does not even control. It
merely aids by an analysis of the books
and by such opinions, expressed on blank
forms provided for the purpose, as show
an outline of plot and treatment, and merits
or defects as they appear, not to trained
literary critics, but to average readers of
some cultivation in different walks of life
or on different social planes.</p>

<p>This committee was one of the excellent
inventions of my predecessor, Dr. Putnam,
and, shortly after its establishment,
it received wide attention from the press,
for the most part based on complete misconception
of its purpose and character.
This resulted in creating an impression
as different as possible from the actual,
but which still persists, as the mother-in-law
joke persists, or the young lady who
plays the piano in the parlor while mother
washes in the kitchen, or the stage
Irishman and Yankee&mdash;stock material of
the pseudo-humorists.</p>

<p>The genial "Librarian" of the Boston
Transcript, who on Saturday is to tell you
how to discourage reading, still has periodic
visions of the "Censors of the Boston
public library," just as more timid souls
have created bogies out of Col. Roosevelt
or other historic characters. But the
committee has no power to "censor" anything,
and the Boston public library has
no "black list" nor has it in my time ever
had to become a censor. It has to choose,
and so far as possible within the exercise
of fallible human judgment to choose
wisely. It finds itself unable to buy some
hundreds of as good books, perhaps better
books, than it buys, but it censors nothing,
being fortunately relieved of a duty from
which I would myself not shrink in exigency,
by the limitations surrounding its
choice.</p>

<p>It is one of the curiosities of journalism,
this rise of the legend of the Boston fiction
committee. It started from a half
jocose article wholly inconsequential, one
would have thought, in a western paper
from the pen of a little-known Boston
space writer. Numerous excellent books
not purchased were said to have been
"tabooed," and the list went over the country
like wild fire. None of them had been
"tabooed," unless inability to buy is a
taboo. Big head lines with Swinburnian
fervor spoke of the "books banned in Boston."
From the little daily papers, the matter
spread to the big ones. The Times
Saturday Review pointed out, after scanning
some of the titles, that "in some
New England minds exquisite pleasure was
akin to wickedness," because of the supposed
censorship of books not bought. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
committee was irreverently alluded to as
the "body of spinster censors who since
they were themselves virtuous had determined
there should be no more cakes and
ale." A critical literary journal feared
that the committee desired "to form Boston's
literary taste on too precious a
model," and that since the majority of
the readers were women, "the sense of
power may have led them into arbitrary
decisions." A New York paper, not unwilling
to have a shy at Boston, said: "The
committee takes an attitude untenable,
Pharasaic, and what the enemies of Boston
call Bostonese."</p>

<p>Harper's Weekly, a journal of civilization,
expressed curiosity about the committee:
"That the majority of them are
young, we know, because they are not married.
But are they red, white, or blue
stockings? Do they approve of straight
fronts? Do hoops still gallop in the East
wind?" Drastic comments were received
and appeared in print from other librarians.
Mr. Legler's predecessor, entirely
in good faith, fell with the rest. He said
he had been told that in Boston they sent
new novels to club women and received
their opinions on slips of paper. He imagined
that a good dinner would have something
to do with such reports.</p>

<p>The St. Louis Globe Democrat had
a word of commendation, although equally
misled as to the grounds of praise. It
said: "The literary lines are drawn as
sharply and perhaps as arbitrarily as the
social ones. Yet this New England trait
of severe selection is a blessing to the
country, and has leavened its crudeness
from ocean to ocean. Puritanism has been
more or less a critic of the rest of us, but
the criticism has done good. * * * There
is doubtless good reason for the rejections
made." But the New York Sun which still
shines for all, said: "The city was so terribly
agitated over the wicked censorship
of fiction at the library that the reading
committee is doomed to become an extinct
institution."</p>

<p>All of this is ancient history, and I only
recall it as showing, in little, the growth
of a popular myth. The committee as an
institution still lives. It has always been
representative. As the Bookman once said
of its lists of best sellers, so, in dealing
with the reports, we are not under the
impression that we are pointing solemnly
to stupendous critical opinions. We do
not even claim that every individual report
is actually accurate and unbiased.
But we do believe that collected and
weighed, they are unbiased and accurate
in the bulk. The committee in its membership
is subject to frequent changes. It
is, as I have said, free from library influence.
Its members are appointed by the
committee itself and we neither approve
nor cancel appointments. At present there
are 27 members, men and women, married
and unmarried, (10 unmarried ladies comprise
the spinster element), Protestants
and Catholics, French, German, Spanish,
as well as those to whom English is the
mother tongue.</p>

<p>They are all fairly intelligent, not illiterate
of course, but not offensively scholarly.
They include artists and teachers,
several literary persons, at least two authors
of repute, a business man or two,
two physicians, and so on. This analysis
shows the representative character of the
committee; that it is made up with
breadth of selection. Its verdict is not
conclusive, and aims to reflect only the
opinion which readers of intelligence
would form after careful reading. Other
factors are always taken into account
in determining whether or not a book
shall be bought. Necessarily, many current
novels approved by the committee
are not bought. Frequently novels are
bought which the committee did not approve.
But the experience of several years
has shown that nearly all which for various
reasons we have found it impossible
to buy have failed to demonstrate their
right to live for even a few brief months.
The demand for some of them was insistent
for a short time. Now, their very
names are forgotten. If we had purchased
a considerable number of them, the money,
so far as present demand is concerned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
would have been wasted. It may be fairly
said, however, that we have bought
meantime, so far as our resources permitted,
a fair representation of the best fiction,
that which is likely to remain in constant
request. Our supply of standard English
fiction is large, perhaps 50,000 volumes,
and is constantly replaced as the
books wear out. We are liberal in providing
good fiction for the young. Were
our funds enlarged, we could undoubtedly
use a larger number of copies, especially
in branch and deposit work, but, as I have
made clear, we cannot expend a larger
amount of our money in this way without
impairing the growth of the library in
other important directions. Whether or not
you approve the method that we find helpful,
some plan of selection must be adopted
since choice is imperative.</p>

<p>Of course, it would be possible to buy
two copies of 500 different books, or, as
at present, perhaps 10 copies of 100 books;
the expense would be the same in either
case. But in the first instance the chances
of a borrower getting a copy of any book
selected would be much reduced in comparison
with his chance of getting one
under the more limited range of titles. Of
course, also, under the first plan, the library
would be free from the impression
that many novels had been "banned," but
the public advantage is greater under the
present system.</p>

<p>I have already taken too long. If you
find anything in our plan helpful, I shall
be glad. At any rate, I hope I have done
something to lay the ghost of unreasonable
censorship which some of you may imagine
hovers over the Boston public library. We
have our faults in Boston, but not that.</p>

<p>Let me take a moment in summing up.
Every librarian must determine for himself
how much money he ought to spend
for fiction, under his own local conditions,
within his own resources. He should try
to keep a proper proportion in this expenditure,
not as measured in Boston or elsewhere
but in that little corner of the earth
where his own library is placed. This is
a personal matter, not one of invariable
mathematical relations.</p>

<p>Having done that, he should establish
a standard and select with reference to it.
Not my standard&mdash;it may not fit the case&mdash;but
his own. And this too, like most library
functions, is a personal matter. It
will depend largely on what the librarian
is trying to do with his library. For a library
should not be a dead thing. It
should have a vital relation to the particular
community in which it is placed, and
fit it as the glove fits the hand. Through
the books we circulate we are directly influencing
the men and women we reach;
not for their personal benefit or enjoyment
only, or to satisfy only their individual
tastes or desires; but that they may become
better fitted for their civic duties,
may become happier, more intelligent,
more hopeful in their human relationships.</p>

<p>It is not the book that you give John
Smith for the benefit of John Smith only,
that counts, but the book that makes John
Smith of greater benefit to the community.
That sentence, which I quote in spirit if
not in exact words from our colleague,
Dr. Richardson, expresses the reason for
being of the public library, the only justification
for the maintenance of such libraries
by general taxation. Whatever books
contribute to that end are the books that
should be bought.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the book itself as
it lies on the shelf. It is neither moral
nor immoral nor of any other intrinsic
merit or demerit. "Three weeks," 12 copies
of which a commercial circulating library
in a small city near my home kept
in constant circulation for a year, is as
good as another in that inert position. But
books in contact with the soul of humanity
are no longer dead things. They have
something of that vital quality which gave
them birth, as Milton long ago said.</p>

<p>It is sometimes as much our duty to
restrain readers as to stimulate them, and
a large circulation per capita without regard
to the character of the books circulated,
is as apt to be a sign of the inef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>ficiency
of a library, as it is a thing to
be emulated.</p>

<p>This is not a recital of platitudes nor
does the subject call for beautiful phrases
about the ideals of the librarian's profession.
On the contrary, it concerns practical
results in return for the taxpayers'
money, which comes hard enough at best.
It is no heart-breaking matter whether you
buy and circulate 50, 60 or 70 per cent of
fiction. If you bring your percentage down
from 70 to 50, that of itself may not mean
improvement. But it is heart-breaking if
you fail to get the books best adapted to
secure the results I assume you are trying
to obtain and which you ought to obtain
in your own community.</p>

<p>It may be that what Mr. Dana once facetiously
called the "latest tale of broken
hearthstones" is just the thing to give a
fillip to the dormant sensibilities of your
patrons&mdash;to make them sit up and take
notice lest cracked hearthstones become
fashionable in your vicinity. I do not know.
But this I know. You should settle that
point with your own conscience, and when
you have settled it, go on, and do not apologize.
In the long run your sins whether
of omission or commission, will find you
out. On the other hand, believe me, virtue
in this field as in others, will bring its own
reward, and the reward of virtue is about
the only one any librarian can reasonably
expect.</p>

<p>Dr. Bostwick was called upon to continue
the discussion and spoke as follows:</p>


<h4>The Quality of Fiction&mdash;II.</h4>

<p>The two things that it is necessary to
take into account in selecting literature
are its form and its content. The former
largely determines the literary value of a
composition; the latter its practical usefulness.
Poetry and prose are the two great
basic forms into which all literature is divided.
Narrative may be cast in either
form and when that narrative is untrue we
call it fiction. In the usage of most of us
the word is restricted to prose. Fiction,
therefore, is not so much a matter of form
as of content, or rather of the quality of
content. Of two books telling of the lives
of the same kind of persons in the same
way the mere fact that one is true and the
other not would class one as biography and
the other as fiction.</p>

<p>Of what importance is the fact that of
two bits of narrative, one is true and the
other is untrue? That depends on the purpose
for which the narrative is to be used.
If we desire an accurate and orderly statement
of facts, the true narrative is the
only one of value. On the other hand, the
facts, not of the narrative but incidental to
it, may be true in the fiction and false in
the biography. From the standpoint of the
seeker of recreation, the fiction is generally,
although not always, more interesting.
The writer has the advantage of being able
to create the elements of his tale and control
their grouping, as well as regulate
their form; and in addition he knows that
he must be interesting to secure readers.
Unfortunately, historians, biographers and
travellers have generally too high an opinion
of their functions as purveyors of truth
to stoop to make it interesting.</p>

<p>As regards literary value, of course the
mere truth or falsity of the narrative can
have little to do with this; yet I believe, as
a matter of fact, that fictitious narrative
has literary value oftener than true narrative;
for the reason offered above, that
writers of truth consider it beneath their
dignity to garnish it, like those fatuous dieticians
who believe that so long as we
take so much proteid and so much carbohydrate
we need not worry over forms and
flavors. Now I am supposed to be telling
you about fiction and about the propriety
or impropriety of including much of it in
libraries, but I think you see that I am sidling
toward the statement that I think we
need not consider fiction at all, as fiction,
in this connection. The reasons for rejecting
fiction, when they exist, have nothing
whatever to do with its being fiction, and
would apply to non-fiction as well. If a biography
purporting to relate the events in
the life of Oliver Cromwell is full of errors,
that is a reason why it should not stand
on your library shelves. If a novel, pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>porting
to give a correct idea of life in
Chicago, succeeds only in leaving the impression
that the city is peopled with silly
and immoral persons, that is equally a reason
for rejection. If a history of the Italian
Renaissance is filled with unsavory details,
these might exclude it, just as they
might exclude a novel whose scene was
laid in the same period. The story of a
criminal's life, if so written as to make
wrong appear right, might be rejected for
this reason whether the criminal really existed
or not. A poor, trashy book of travel
should no more be placed on the shelves
than a novel of the same grade. And if our
book funds are limited we can no more buy
all the biography or travel or books on
chemistry or philosophy than we can buy
all the novels that fall from the press. I
do not deny, of course, that any or all the
reasons for rejection that have been adduced
might be overbalanced by others in
favor of purchase, and they might be so
overbalanced in the case of fiction as well
as in that of non-fiction.</p>

<p>In other words I should not buy a book
because it is fiction, or turn it down for
the same reason, any more than I would
buy or fail to buy a book because it is biography
or travel. I say I should not do
this any more in one case than in another;
I might want to do it occasionally in both.
But I believe that the more we forget the
mere issue of fiction versus non-fiction and
try instead to draw the line between useful
books and harmful ones, wise books
and silly ones, books that help and books
that hinder, books that exalt and those
that depress, books that excite high emotions
and books that stir up low ones&mdash;the
sooner we shall be good librarians.</p>

<p>Following Dr. Bostwick's remarks the
subject was thrown open to discussion by
members at large.</p>

<p>The chairman said that at his request
some very interesting facts had been extracted
from the annual published statements
in Publishers' Weekly, respecting
so-called best books of the year. These
statements showed that many of the books
which were leading books of particular
years, ten, fifteen and eighteen years ago,
had absolutely disappeared from the list
of books which are now in current favor.
Some of these books were found to be unknown
to those who are now engaged in
book selection.</p>

<p>Replying to the question as to the percentage
of fiction of books bought by public
libraries in Canada, Mr. W. O. Carson
of London, Ont., stated that in his library
the percentage of fiction ran from twenty
to twenty-five per cent and he thought
that was a fair average for other Canadian
libraries. Mr. Carson said that the Ontario
government bases the government grant
on the amount of money expended on
books and they give no grant on fiction if
it exceed more than forty-five per cent of
the amount expended on other books, so
in the majority of the small libraries, they
do not expend more than thirty per cent on
fiction for fear of losing a government
grant on anything that exceeds that
amount. Replacements are included in this
percentage.</p>

<p>Dr. Steiner said that a number of years
ago Mr. Ranck and he prepared a paper on
replacements and their attention was
called to the very large proportion of expenditure
for replacements which had to
be used for fiction and that this was particularly
noticeable in a library of some
age, as in the case of the Enoch Pratt Free
library of Baltimore. The speaker thought
it should be borne in mind in connection
with the purchase, whether the amount
expended was mostly for current fiction,
mostly for replacements, whether a new
branch was being stocked or whether a
library was being stocked which had not
been sufficiently provided previously with
standard works. The exact proportion of
fiction in any one year should be governed
by these three factors, if not by others. Dr.
Steiner said that their library last year
wore out in round numbers about 7,000
books, of which at a rough guess at least
six-sevenths were fiction. They replaced
about 5,000 books including most of the
non-fiction books, leaving from 1,500 to
2,000 volumes in fiction which were al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>lowed
to expire by limitation. In every
case where a book wears out, the circulation
department reports whether that book
is regarded by them as being worthy of replacement
and if the book be not a duplicate
but is an original copy the recommendation
is always brought to the librarian,
who occasionally overrules the decision
of the circulation department in the
case of original copies, but so far as duplicates
are concerned, the opinion of the circulation
department is absolutely accepted.</p>

<p>Dr. Andrews said he had found it very
useful in the work of selection to discriminate
between those books the library does
not intend to buy at present and those
which it will not accept even as a gift, and
that in fiction it might be especially valuable
to have some line of exclusion. He
asked whether the chairman or Miss Bascom
could recall what is the proportion
of comparison between the recommendation
of the Boston book committee as read
by Mr. Wadlin and that of the A. L. A.
Booklist.</p>

<p>Miss Bascom replied that as she recalled
it for 1912 of about 1,000 novels published
about 140 were included in the Booklist,
adding that she supposed that the greater
number of the entire output were read.</p>

<p>The chairman said that from figures
which he had caused to be compiled, it
was found that in this country and Great
Britain something like 80,000 titles belonging
to the classification of fiction had been
printed since 1882 in this country and 1880
in Great Britain. Mr. Wadlin said that the
A. L. A. Booklist contained titles of fiction
which the Boston public library had not
bought simply because they could not, having
bought other things instead. Local
conditions govern their book selection to a
considerable extent.</p>

<p>The question being raised whether librarians
experienced any considerable pressure
brought to bear upon them to purchase
certain books, the opinion was expressed
by Mr. Ranck, Mr. Wadlin and others that
this pressure was not nearly so great as
one might think would be the case, that
those demanding the purchase of a certain
book were reminded that the library had a
limited income and that the question of selection
always had to be very carefully considered
and that books not purchased were
not necessarily excluded for any other reason
than lack of funds.</p>

<p>Representatives of the library schools
being asked to what extent the lectures
given in library schools were intended to
exert an influence either for or against
the wide purchase of fiction, Miss Hazeltine
of the University of Wisconsin library
school, said it was their effort to teach the
students to buy the best books with the
money at their disposal&mdash;those of the best
literary value&mdash;and to buy many duplicates
of the best fiction.</p>

<p>Dr. Bostwick said that those libraries
that have pay collections of duplicates
ought to state whether their reports include
the pay collections of duplicates or
not and what relation this collection bears
to the original copies. In St. Louis it is
the tendency to buy rather a small number
of copies of each work of fiction for regular
use and put these books as far as possible
into duplicate collections. The pay
collection of duplicates in St. Louis varies
very much. In three of the branches it has
not even been begun, the librarians of
these branches reporting that there is no
demand for it. In two branches it is very
popular and in the central library fairly so.</p>

<p>Dr. Hill thought it was not wise to give
a smaller number of copies to the public
for free use than to the department where
pay is requested. It seemed to him that
the public should have just as many copies
of a book as those who can afford to pay
one or two cents a day. In Brooklyn they
give the same number of copies to the free
circulating department as to the duplicate
pay department. Dr. Hill said the Brooklyn
public library last year spent for replacement,
juvenile and adult, $50,000 out
of the $80,000 which was spent for books,
or something like 60 per cent for fiction
both new and replacements.</p>

<p>The chairman said he was much interested
in a statement printed in Collier's
about two or three years ago in which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
enumerated the result of the publishing activities
of the father of the present publisher,
who started the line of inexpensive
editions of Dickens, Scott and others of a
similar character. It was noted in that
summary that the firm had sold in this
country seven million copies of the works
of Charles Dickens and four or five million
copies of Scott's works, not individual titles,
but the complete works of those authors.
This means of course that a surprisingly
large number of the best novels
by these writers must be in the homes of
the people who use the public libraries
and that these people use the libraries
to supplement their own private collections.
Consequently, no particular conclusions
can be drawn as to the actual character
of the reading done by these people
from the fact that books they get from the
public libraries are mostly the quality of
fiction which is put out at the present time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sneed said there was one rule for
the selection of fiction which she generally
gave to her library school class every year.
This was the rule of Henry van Dyke: A
book of fiction is really worthy to be
bought if it has not given an untrue picture
of life, if it has not made vice attractive
or separated an act from its consequences.
The speaker thought that if this rule was
applied in reading one would not go so very
far astray.</p>

<p>Mr. Bishop said he had been greatly interested
in the last five years in the selections
made by the public itself. The Library
of Congress receives, of course, all
the copyrighted fiction and places one copy
at least of practically every book of permanent
value upon its shelves. After the
temporary agitation of the immediate advertising
is over the public itself goes back
to lines that are surprisingly good in every
way.</p>

<p>Mr. Gould said that Mr. Dutton, the publisher
of Everyman's Library, recently told
him that he had now sold over one and a
half million copies of the books in Everyman's
Library, which was a good indication
of the market found for standard
works.</p>

<p>Mr. Jast, the English delegate, being
called upon by the chair, contributed also
to the general discussion, after which the
session adjourned.</p>

<p>Your Committee on affiliated societies
respectfully report that they have proceeded
in the way proposed and approved
by the Council at its meeting in January.
They regret that circumstances have prevented
them from presenting a final report
but they believe that substantial progress
has been made.</p>

<p>In May the Committee sent to the presidents
of the four affiliated societies the following
letter:</p>

<p>"The Council of the A. L. A. has appointed
a committee to formulate the relations
which should exist between the Association
and affiliated associations other
than state, provincial, etc., in return for
the privileges accorded them. The committee
understand that this action was
taken largely because one or two of the
societies had expressed a desire to contribute
toward the expenses of the Association.
This desire was duly appreciated
by the council, who felt that it would be
well to take definite and formal action.
The committee propose that hereafter
these privileges shall not be extended to
other than affiliated societies without formal
vote of the council, except that the
program committee will be authorized to
do so for the first meeting of any newly-formed
society. They propose to recommend,
also, that the present provision shall
be continued,&mdash;namely, that each affiliated
society shall meet with the Association at
least once every three years. They also
expect to recommend that some contribution
towards expenses be required, but
wish that the manner and the amount of
the assessment be determined after consultation
with the societies, and have
asked that I secure an expression of your
opinion on these points. They would consider
the amount suggested by one of the
societies,&mdash;namely $25.00, as a maximum.
The grounds for such a contribution are
evident, but it may be well to state them
as follows:</p>

<p>"1. Participation in the special railway
accommodations.</p>

<p>"2. Provision for rooms and meals at
reduced rates.</p>

<p>"3. Provision of rooms and time for
meetings.</p>

<p>"4. Participation in the activities of the
meeting.</p>

<p>"5. Printing programs, announcements
in the Bulletin, and assignment of 15 pages
in the Proceedings.</p>

<p>"The cost of preparing for and holding
a convention is about $500.00, that of the
Bulletin and Proceedings, including editing
and distributing, about $1,500.00. Provision
of hotel rooms and travel facilities
is not a matter of money, but frequently
involves disappointment to individual members
who apply too late.</p>

<p>"As stated already, the committee have
not agreed on any amount or method. They
have considered a flat amount of $15.00 to
$25.00, one dependent on the number of
members in the society, who are not members
of the Association, and one dependent
on the number of such members who attend.</p>

<p>"Personally, I think the logical method
would be a combination of the first and
third, and suggest that there be an initial
amount of $10.00 or $15.00 and an additional
charge of 50 cents or 25 cents for
each member attending who is not a member
of the Association. Of course, this additional
charge will not be asked for official
delegates of libraries who are members.</p>

<p>"Kindly let me have an expression of
your opinion on this subject at your earliest
convenience and oblige.</p>

<p>They have just now received replies
from all and formal action has been taken
by two. All, though perhaps with varying
degrees of cordiality and readiness, recognize
the justice of the proposed arrangement.
There is quite naturally some variance
in their suggestions as to the proper
amount of the contribution to be made and
the method by which it is to be computed.
The committee desire to consider carefully
these suggestions and to reconcile
their variations as nearly as possible.
They would like to discuss them in a personal
meeting of the whole committee, as
well as by correspondence, and hope that
the winter meeting of the council will afford
them an opportunity to do so, and to
formulate a by-law for the consideration

<h2>AGRICULTURAL LIBRARIES SECTION</h2>


<p class="center">(Round Table, June 27, 1913, 2:30 p. m.)</p>

<p>Mr. Charles R. Green, librarian of the
Massachusetts Agricultural College, was
acting chairman of the meeting, which was
an informal one without a regular program.
Miss Emma B. Hawks, of the U. S.
Department of Agriculture library, acted
as secretary. The subjects for discussion
were (1) Catalog cards for agricultural experiment
station publications and (2) The
indexing of agricultural periodicals.</p>

<p>Mr. C. H. Hastings first spoke briefly in
regard to the printing of cards by the Library
of Congress for the publications of
the state agricultural experiment stations.
Cards have already been issued for the
Illinois and Indiana station bulletins, the
copy being supplied by the university libraries.
Before going on with the work for the
other stations, he thought it desirable to
consult with the Office of Experiment Stations
in regard to a plan of co-operation by
which the same card might be used both
for the Library of Congress cards and for
the "Card index to experiment station literature"
issued by the office. It would be
much more economical to have only the
one card printed, if possible. Miss E. B.
Hawks expressed doubt as to whether
such an arrangement could be made, inasmuch
as the form and purpose of the Office
of Experiment Stations card index differ
so widely from those of a dictionary
catalog. Mr. Hastings thought that it
would do no harm to make the attempt and
said that he would consult with the librarian
of the Department of Agriculture and
the director of the Office of Experiment
Stations in regard to it. If such an arrangement
can not be made he thought
the Library of Congress would be willing
to print separate cards, having the copy
supplied by the station or college libraries,
if they are willing and able to do the cataloging.</p>

<p>Mr. H. W. Wilson then spoke in regard
to the publication of an index to agricultural
periodicals. He stated that he has
had a good many demands for such an index
and has delayed adding any agricultural
titles to the Industrial Arts Index, because
it may be better to have a separate
one. Those who have written to him about
it have almost always expressed a preference
for a separate index. Miss Hawks
asked whether some titles might not be included
in the Industrial Arts Index now,
and then removed if a separate agricultural
one were begun. Mr. Wilson replied
that there was some likelihood of the Agricultural
Index being begun next year, in
which case it would hardly pay to do anything
with the agricultural literature before
this. There was some discussion as
to the scope of the index. Mr. Wilson said
they would wish to include only journals
of national standing. Mr. C. R. Green
thought that there were not more than
about six of these. Mr. H. O. Severance
thought there would be many more than
this, including papers devoted to special
phases, as poultry, bee keeping and stock
raising. Dr. C. W. Andrews doubted
whether the farm papers were worth indexing.
He thought that the matter was
rarely original, but that the articles of
value are worked up from Station and Department
of Agriculture publications. Mr.
Wilson said he had had more demands for
an Agricultural Index lately than for an
index of any other subject.</p>

<p>Inquiry was made as to how many subscriptions
would be needed to justify the
starting of a separate index. Mr. Wilson
could not say definitely. There might be
two plans&mdash;one, the division of subscriptions
among subscribers. The basis for the
Industrial Arts Index was 20 cents a title&mdash;40
cents for a weekly. The other plan
is a sliding scale of charges by which a library
having a great many of the periodicals
indexed pays a higher price, thus enabling
the smaller ones to pay something
but not a higher price than they can afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
for the service rendered. Mr. Wilson stated
that he was willing to go to the expense
of a referendum to find out the wishes of
libraries on this subject, with a view either
to the starting of a separate index or the
incorporation of some agricultural journals
in the Industrial Arts Index. If the
idea of a separate index is abandoned, he
would almost certainly add some titles to
the Industrial Arts Index. Mr. Green
thought that he might count on active support
of the Department of Agriculture library
and all the agricultural experiment
stations. He was not sure what further
support there would be. Mr. Wilson
thought the demand would probably be an
increasing one.</p>

<h2>CATALOG SECTION</h2>


<h3>FIRST SESSION</h3>

<p>The first session of the Catalog Section
was held Wednesday afternoon, June 25th,
the chairman, Miss Harriet B. Gooch, of
the Pratt Institute school of library science,
presiding. As the minutes of the
last meeting had been published, their
reading was omitted.</p>

<p>The report of the committee on the
cost and method of cataloging was called
for, in response to which Mr. A. G. S.
Josephson, Chairman of the committee,
stated the present report was but a preliminary
one, to be followed by a final report
next year. The Catalog Section took
no action on the report since the committee
was appointed by the Executive Board
of the Association, not by the section.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

connection with the minutes of the Executive
Board.</p></div>

<p>Miss Gooch then stated that the discussion
for the afternoon was the administration
of the catalog department considered
first in its relation to the other departments
of the library, and second as to its
management of its own affairs looking
toward simple, inexpensive and rapid methods
of work. She explained that the discussion
was concerned with library systems
consisting of a central library with
a number of branch libraries, and was to
be treated both from the librarian's and
from the cataloger's point of view.</p>

<p>The discussion was opened by Mr. F.
F. HOPPER, of the Tacoma public library.</p>


<h3>ADMINISTRATION OF THE CATALOG
DEPARTMENT FROM A LIBRARIAN'S
POINT OF VIEW</h3>

<p>In the reorganization of our libraries, in
the adoption of modern progressive and
simplified methods, in the effort to develop
and improve service to the public, the
catalog department has tended to be drawn
out of relation to the other departments, to
become in a way isolated, and as a result
its efficiency has been impaired. The attention
of librarians has been given to
other phases of library activities and
therefore they know less about the catalog
department than any other. Undoubtedly
the technicalities of the cataloging process
make it most difficult for librarians to
grapple with, but all the more carefully
should we consider ways and means of increasing
the efficiency of the process, relating
the work more closely to changes
in other departments, and studying methods
of possible simplification of the routine
mechanical work that seems to have largely
increased of late.</p>

<p>In one of Mr. Carlton's reports to his
board of trustees, he uses these words: "It
has often seemed to me that in library
administration the catalog department was
much like the police department in municipal
administration. It is frequently under
investigation; it is constantly being reformed;
its defects are felt in many other
departments; and its heads are always
changing as one after another breaks down
or fails to achieve impossible results."</p>

<p>Surely such an unsatisfactory and un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>wholesome
condition is not without remedy.</p>

<p>If I can not presume to submit a definite
plan of reformation, perhaps I may at
least attempt to suggest possible lines of
investigation for each librarian to pursue.</p>

<p>1. The catalog room.</p>

<p>In the modern organization of work, the
first care is to provide work-rooms in which
the highest efficiency may be maintained.
Scientific investigation shows the extravagance
of conditions which retard speed and
multiply unnecessary motions, which do
not provide adequate light and air and
proper colors to conserve strength, arrest
fatigue and support the energies. In planning
buildings we properly endeavor to
bring the catalog department into the closest
possible relation with the order department,
the book stack and the reference department,
to save steps which mean time
and money. My observation is that frequently
there is not the same care exercised
in planning the room itself as there
is in locating it. Often it is too small, so
that work clogs up, books must be shifted
too often (an expensive process), too
many corners must be turned in getting
about the room and the assistants impede
one another's progress. On the other hand,
a room may be so large that time is wasted
in getting about it. To be sure this is a
rare fault. I have seen cataloging rooms
admirably placed for convenience of access
to stack, reference room and order
department, and really adequate in size,
but so devoid of light and air that even a
hardened devotee of our reading rooms
would fear to enter such a place. Plenty of
windows, if possible on two sides of a
room, and ample indirect artificial lighting
are just as important for the efficiency of
the catalog department as like facilities for
the public reading rooms.</p>

<p>2. Relation of catalog department to
other departments.</p>

<p>When friction develops between two departments
(of course it never does; this
is merely a hypothetical case), my observation
is that the catalog department is
pretty likely to be a party to the affair.
Why? Simply because as organization
within libraries has developed, the catalog
department has been left more and
more to its own devices. In the departments
working with the public, the tendency
has been to complexity of organization,
perhaps, but still to elimination of
detail, simplification of method, the sacrifice
of theory to practicality that the public
may have the feeling of freedom and
ease and be given the quickest and best
service with the least red tape. During
this process the catalog department has
continued to develop theory unchecked by
daily strenuous contact with the busy borrower,
to increase routine and mechanical
work, still opaque to the searchlight of
scientific investigation from outside the
department. You need publicity, but all
you ever get is pages and pages of blasts
against the poor old battle-scarred, but
more-or-less-still-in-the-ring accession book,
which in nine cases out of ten belongs to
another department anyway. The illuminating
power of publicity for the devious
ways of cataloging and the development of
a better spirit of co-operation, are to be
obtained perhaps best of all by the establishment
of entirely feasible definite relations
between the departments. As Miss
Winser will develop this topic, I will leave
it here, simply remarking that in my experience
the opinions of one department
about the organization and detail of another
department are frequently of the utmost
value, but rarely the opinions of
other departments about the catalog department,
whose problems are not understood.</p>

<p>3. Organization of the department.</p>

<p>(1) General type of organization.</p>

<p>The development of the modern elaborate
systems of scientific management in
the various forms of industry has for the
most part superseded the best type of ordinary
management known as the "initiative
and incentive system." Under the old
system success depends almost entirely
upon the initiative of the workmen, whereas,
under scientific management, or task
management, a complete science for all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
operations is developed, and the managers
assume new burdens, new duties and responsibilities.
Having developed the science,
they scientifically select and then
train, teach and develop the workmen.
The managers co-operate with the men to
insure all the work being done in accordance
with the principles of the science
which has been developed. The work and
responsibility are almost equally divided
between the management and the workmen.
The combination of the initiative
of the workmen and the new types of work
done by the management makes scientific
management so much more efficient than
the old way.</p>

<p>"All the planning which under the old
system was done by the workman, as a
result of his personal experience, must of
necessity under the new system be done
by the management in accordance with the
laws of the science."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> One type of man is
needed to plan ahead and an entirely different
type to execute the work. Perhaps
the most prominent single element in modern
scientific management is the task idea.
The work of each workman is fully planned
in advance by the management and the
man receives complete written instructions,
describing in detail the task he is to accomplish,
as well as the means to be used
in doing the work. And the work planned
in advance in this way constitutes a task
which is to be solved by the joint effort of
the workman and the management. This
task specifies not only what is to be done,
but how it is to be done and the exact
time allowed for doing it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> F. W. Taylor, "Principles of scientific
management."</p></div>

<p>It is said that "the most important object
of both the workmen and the management
should be the training and development of
each individual in the establishment, so
that he can do (at his fastest pace and
with the maximum of efficiency) the highest
class of work for which his natural
abilities fit him," but it is nevertheless
true that to some extent scientific management
contemplates the selection of the
workman best fitted for one particular</p>

<p>task and keeping him at that task because
he can do that better than any other.
Within the narrow domain of his special
work, he is given every encouragement to
suggest improvements both in methods and
in implements. In the past the man has
been first; under modern methods the
system is first.</p>

<p>I have attempted to summarize some of
the principles of so-called scientific management,
because in the organization of
our cataloging work definite principles of
any kind of management have rarely been
evident throughout, and if we are to observe
accurately the system of this department,
and study it with a view to possible
improvement, we must test its work by
some existing scientific standards.</p>

<p>The <b>science</b> of cataloging has been pretty
fully developed, and at least its technique
is taught in our professional schools. Therefore
it may be assumed that we are now
reasonably conforming to the first ideals
of scientific management when we select
with due care for the headship of our catalog
departments and for the more important
positions, those trained in the principles
of the science. I personally believe
that the principles of scientific management
should be actively employed by the
head cataloger in the definite planning of
the work of the individual, in the testing
of the speed and accuracy of the individual
for a special task, and in the insistence
that speed for each task shall definitely
conform to careful but easily made tests
of the amount of time that should be consumed
in performing the task. There are
plenty of results of experiments in other
lines of work which show that the output
is increased, the cost lessened, by the
constant planning and supervision and
co-operation of the head of the department,
and consequent abandonment by him of a
corresponding amount of special detail
work of his own that he heretofore may
have done.</p>

<p>But now I must register an emphatic exception
to the application of the exact
principles of scientific management to a
catalog department.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>I believe the principles of scientific management
as developed for the organization
of industry and business, should undergo
a distinct change or be abandoned
entirely in their application to one most
important phase of the organization of a
catalog department. Scientific management
does consider the health and comfort and
freedom from fatigue and efficiency of the
individual, but always with a view to the
effect upon a particular task and upon increased
output at reduced cost. In other
words the emphasis is placed on the task,
not at all on the broad development of the
individual. In library work, human sympathy,
a broad point of view, the fullest
possible development of personality are of
the utmost importance; esprit de corps,
the spirit of loyalty and co-operation are
of more importance than a particular task.
I assume that needs no argument. Scientific
management, fully applied, would, it
seems to me, defeat this vital purpose of
library organization, and would more effectually
differentiate and isolate the catalog
department than is already the case in
many libraries.</p>

<p>This leads to some illustrations of my
meaning by</p>

<p>(2) Some practical considerations of the
organization.</p>

<p>I do entirely believe in a distinct and
complete organization of a catalog department,
not in the system some libraries use
in having a department head, but without
assistants definitely and wholly assigned
to the one department. It is my observation
that to insure quick, accurate, consecutive
and thoroughly efficient work,
not only must the department head devote
practically her whole time to the one job,
but at least enough assistants also, to insure
continuity of work. I am not in favor
of the head of the department being part
of the time assistant in the children's
room or even in the reference room. Such
a plan is altogether too extravagant. The
manager of a department needs to give
undivided attention to the supervision of
the work of the department. The head of
the department is constantly brought directly
in touch with the general administration
of the library and with other department
heads, and a possible tendency to
narrowed point of view is thus checked
to some extent. There are also some assistants
who are naturally fitted to the
work of the catalog department and not at
all to meeting the public. If we secure
an assistant evidently suited for catalog
work, but for no other, we should bend
all our energies to making her the most
efficient possible cataloger, and not deprive
the catalog department of her constant
services in order to make a vain attempt
to develop other sides of her personality
and give the public poor service in the
process. In my judgment, in a library
cataloging from 25,000 to 35,000 volumes a
year, a head cataloger, a first assistant,
and probably at least two other assistants
should give their whole time to the department
and so form the backbone of the organization.
To this part of it the principles
of scientific management may be
thoroughly applied.</p>

<p>My idea of the necessity for divergence
from those principles comes when we consider
the need for the development of some
members of the cataloging staff by other
sides of library experience, and also when
we consider the importance of mutual understanding
and co-operation between the
departments. All librarians experience
difficulty in obtaining assistant catalogers
because a candidate is very often reluctant
to devote herself wholly to the routine operations
of the catalog department. In
many such cases, it would be possible
to secure an excellent part-time assistant
for the catalog department, if we would
offer work for part of the day in a department
dealing with the public. In this way
we would achieve a double purpose. The
experience of all librarians, I am confident,
will indicate the inestimable advantage to
the point of view of the catalog department
and to the catalog itself if some one of considerable
importance in the department
gives a part of each day to reference
work, and another assistant a part of each
day to the loan department. I think it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
not so important that a cataloger devote
some time to work with children, and it
is also true that such an arrangement is
rarely of value to the children's department,
where special qualities and training
are all-important. On the other hand, it
is desirable that someone with the training
and experience of a children's librarian,
give to the catalog department time for
the assignment of subject headings for the
children's catalog. The work of the catalog
and order departments is most closely
related and yet it is my experience that
misunderstanding between those departments
is not infrequent. An assistant
whose time is divided between the two
should and does work to the advantage
of both departments. With the exception
of the one representative from the children's
department, I do not believe that the
possible advantage gained by having assistants
from the departments which deal
with the public give part time to cataloging,
by any means equals the loss of efficiency
attending the change from one manager
to another or the loss in the work
itself, for it is unusual that one assistant
should do equally high-class work in two
such distinct fields. I know that some say
that the majority of really good desk assistants
possess the education, the clear
and discriminating mind, the accuracy and
resourcefulness of the good cataloger and
are of value in the catalog department.
Also it is true that the suitability of each
assistant for each department would of
course be considered when interchanges
are arranged. Nevertheless it is my observation
that excellent desk assistants
ordinarily can do well only the merest
clerical work in a catalog department, and
usually they do not appreciate the accuracy
and minute care required in cataloging
work. Certainly it is extravagant to use a
part of the time of a presumably fairly-well-paid,
good desk or reference assistant
for merely mechanical work in the catalog
department, which otherwise would be
done by a cheaper grade of service than
the better grade of catalog assistants. Also
the special care and extra time wasted by
head catalogers in revising the work of
such assistants is an expense worth consideration.</p>

<p>4. Cost of cataloging.</p>

<p>Many complaints are heard from librarians
of the seemingly excessive cost of cataloging.
Few practical suggestions seem to
have been made for reducing costs, except
in the elimination of some details, such as
accession books. Since I understand a
committee is investigating this whole question,
I have not attempted to obtain any
statistical information. In the few fairly
large libraries whose estimates of the cost
of the process have come to my attention,
the estimated cost of purchasing, accessioning,
and cataloging a book, including
labelling, gilding, card filing, and everything
necessary to secure a book and prepare
it for use, ranges from 30 cents to
about 65 cents. These cost estimates vary,
not only because of differences in the elaboration
or simplicity of the processes, but
also because of the difference in the character
of the books added, large numbers
of duplicates for schools, branches, etc.,
being more easily and cheaply handled
than separate new titles.</p>

<p>There can be little question that scientific
management, properly used, will reduce
the costs of cataloging work. Adequate
planning and supervision of all processes
by the head cataloger, the classifier
and others in charge of divisions of the
work, can make for speed. I am convinced
that we do not really know the
maximum length of time which an assistant
should be allowed to keep at one
certain task. An assistant typewriting
shelf-list cards should do rapid work for
perhaps three hours. After that a measure
of fatigue makes change of occupation advisable
for the individual, and economical
for the department. Slight fatigue from
typewriting will not, however, impair efficiency
in a different sort of work. A
point worth considering here is, that the
change in the occupation of a higher-grade
assistant in order not to impair efficiency,
should not mean time given to a lower or
more mechanical grade of work. That is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
extravagance. Impending mental fatigue
does not mean that mental processes are
to be abandoned. Just as much rest is obtained,
and efficiency is really increased,
by simple change of the mental groove.
Here the advocate of the general exchange
of assistants between departments might
say that the advisable thing to do is to
send the assistant to another department.
In most cases I believe that such a change
is a mistake, because a change from one
department to another means too great a
break in the continuity of management in
two departments. One manager can plan
more effectively for the entire working
time of an individual than two managers
can plan for the two halves.</p>

<p>The development of library schemes of
service, branches, stations, children's
rooms, work with schools, has all added
enormously to the routine and mechanical
processes of cataloging. More shelf-lists,
more catalogs, and all sorts of differentiation
in the processes suitable to the special
need have multiplied details faster than
most librarians realize. It is this tremendous
complexity which has worn out head
catalogers, increased costs, and made administrators
clamor for the elimination of
unnecessary detail, without having a real
understanding of what the detail is and
is for.</p>

<p>Deterioration in the cataloging process
will injure other departments, but undoubtedly
most libraries have superfluous
refinements that could well be omitted
with economy in cataloging, and no loss to
the chief end of all our work.</p>

<p>It is a temptation to consider carefully
the methods which might save expenses
in the cataloging process, but I can take
time only to make brief reference to some
of them, most of these having been frequently
discussed at length before.</p>

<p>(a) Careful planning of catalog room
for convenience, to save all unnecessary
motions.</p>

<p>(b) Scientific supervision of tasks to produce
greatest speed without undue fatigue.</p>

<p>(c) Stopping the publication of many
monthly bulletins. Some bulletins of the
larger and certain particular libraries are
of inestimable value to other libraries.
Most of these bulletins are printed from
the linotype slugs used in printing their
own catalog cards, and consequently the
labor is minimized. The bulletins of most
libraries, I firmly believe, are of no possible
use to other libraries, and the material
in them would be much more read
by the public if published in the newspapers,
as it should be in any case, and if
the special lists, which are the most useful
part of many bulletins, were printed on
a multigraph, instead of being buried in
forbidding bulletins that no able-bodied ordinary
man in his senses could be driven
to read.</p>

<p>(d) Use of Library of Congress cards.
Some people say they do not save time.
I recommend those people to recatalog a
library without them, also to attempt to
get along without them for a while for
current additions. To the best of my
knowledge they do save money, and I
know they save wear and tear on typewriter
machines and ribbons, and they
save temper, which is nervous energy and
worth while saving. If you don't believe
that last read Goldmark on "Fatigue and
efficiency" and then you will. Besides, Library
of Congress cards look better than
typewritten cards and have more durability,
since typewritten cards rub and
fade and have to be rewritten too frequently.</p>

<p>(e) What real objection can there be
to simplifying the cards you write yourselves?
It does not matter if they are not
consistent with Library of Congress cards.
No living borrower would know whether
they were consistent or not, and no dead
one would matter. Besides if variety is
the spice of life, consistency is the vice of
it. Nobody but a librarian ever worried
about being consistent. I regret I can't
even except the clergy.</p>

<p>(f) Omitting book numbers for fiction
saves a vast amount of time and sacrifices
little. They do not add beauty, and they
cause endless trouble and expense without
due compensation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>(g) As to the accession book: I mention
this because everyone does, and
therefore, lack the courage to pass it without
remark. Some library reports say
that they save the time of one assistant
by doing away with it. The fact that
practically all of them say it, no matter
what size the library in question is, makes
one suspicious. I think they are just copying
each other's reports, which is not fair.
If, however, the accession book is abandoned,
and the bill-date, source and cost
for each copy of a book are added to a
shelf-list card which contains author, title,
publisher and perhaps date of publication,
much writing is saved and all necessary information
is preserved. In the Minneapolis
public library, which makes the closest
estimate I have seen, four hours per
150 books are said to be saved by such a
method. No small matter! It is my personal
opinion that the accession book is
superfluous in a library which is completely
cataloged and shelf-listed.</p>

<p>(h) An interesting change due to the
study of motions is recommended in the
procedure for shelf-listing by the Minneapolis
public library: "Formerly one person
marked the call number on the back
of the title page, and assigned the copy
letter, then the book was taken by another
assistant who marked the book slip,
the pocket and the label. This meant two
people handling the book, the second doing
only the mechanical work of copying;
hence the work must be revised by someone
else, or many mistakes occurred in
the work of even our best markers. Now,
the shelf-lister, who knows the meaning
of the number and has it already in her
mind, marks all books as she lists them,
and the work goes through faster and
more accurately."</p>

<p>(i) Trying to save money by omitting
the yearly inventory, particularly for open
shelves, is a mistake, I believe. One does
not save money by gaining discredit for
failing to keep track of his wares.</p>

<p>(j) It is doubtless superfluous to recommend
throwing away antiques, like withdrawal
books.</p>

<p>(k) The use of the multigraph for writing
catalog and shelf-list cards is certainly
economy if the number of catalogs
is large enough to require pretty large
duplication. The shifting of much mechanical
work to a less highly-paid class of
assistant and the saving in revision of all
but the first copy of a card, are distinct
gains.</p>

<p>(l) There are doubtless many mechanical
devices which will be adopted to advantage
in cataloging in the next few years.
Many machines of different sorts have
greatly changed bookkeeping methods,
making the bookkeeper an initiative force
in administration of business houses, and
certainly similar economy systems will
be developed for the cataloger.</p>

<p>5. Efficiency of the individual in the department.</p>

<p>The routine work of cataloging brings
fatigue sooner than an occupation involving
more variety, although the effects of
this form of fatigue may not cumulate so
rapidly. It is consequently of special importance
that the executive pay particular
attention to the application of the principles
of scientific management to the efficiency
of the individual. The utmost care
must be taken that energy shall be carefully
directed and not be over-expended.
Unduly prolonged attention to a particular
kind of work resulting in the long run
in nervous exhaustion is a familiar phenomenon
of cataloging. Dr. Richardson
says that for correction and verification
work, two hours a day is the maximum
for highest efficiency. My observation is
that continuous work at the typewriter
should not exceed three hours. Although
filing is largely mechanical work, it is also
very wearying because of the decided
monotony of it, and there is a marked
tendency to tire quickly. Since errors
rapidly increase with fatigue, the service is
directly injured, as well as indirectly
through the ultimate effect on the health
of the individual.</p>

<p>In general the carefully trained assistant
not only knows how to go about his
work with more dispatch, with less need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
for supervision, with more real efficiency,
but also with less wear and tear on his
nervous energy. An added argument for
the economy of paying higher salaries to
obtain adequately trained assistants! I
have had excellent opportunity to observe
the effect of the graded salary on the efficiency
of a cataloging staff. The increased
interest, the new energy, and the
altered spirit are marked when a graded
service is installed, particularly when it is
realized that efficiency, as well as length
of service, is considered.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to discuss recreation
in the library, as the subject relates to
the catalog department no differently than
it does to the others. The same may be
said about vacations, but in passing I
should like to say that I agree entirely
with Dr. Bostwick's idea of them as assignments
to special work. It seems to me
that assistants should be required to obtain
the approval of the executive to the plans
for their vacations. I have taken vacations
myself which were certain to do me no
good, and consequently do my work harm,
and it does seem that I ought not to expect
pay for such a misuse of the library's
time. The change in the hours of service
in the circulation department of the New
York public library from 42&frac12; hours a week
to 40 hours has caused widespread approval.
I wonder if anyone has called attention
to the fact that slight changes
in climate affect the ability of the individual
to work a certain number of hours.
For instance, I know from experience that
it is possible to work longer without discomfort
in an even climate, not subject to
extremes of either heat or cold, than it is
in the climate of New York. There are
certain parts of the country where it takes
less energy to work 42 hours per week
throughout the year than it does to work
40 hours correspondingly in New York.</p>

<p>With more attention to light, air, attractive
appearance and convenient arrangement
of room, avoidance of fatigue in
spite of rapid work or monotony, sensible
hours, some degree of variety in work,
sane vacations, some outdoor exercise during
each day, decent pay on a graded basis,
the efficiency record of the cataloging staff
in many a library should be raised, their
organization held intact, and their humor
and good-humor have some chance to appear.</p>

<p>The subject was continued by Dr. ARTHUR
E. BOSTWICK, of the St. Louis
public library, who spoke as follows:</p>

<p>From the administrative standpoint the
library life of a book is divided very distinctly
into two periods, that before it
is placed on the shelves and that after it
is so placed. The first period, embracing
selection, order, receipt, classification, cataloging
and mechanical preparation, is
strictly preliminary to the second and
would have no reason for being except
for the second. The public recognizes the
second chiefly and knows of the first
vaguely and inadequately. To the library,
and especially to that part of the staff
engaged in the operations proper to it, it
bulks large.</p>

<p>The librarian of a large library often
finds himself obliged to act, in a measure,
as the public's representative, taking the
point of view of the thousands of readers,
rather than of those who operate the
machinery directly under his own control.
To one who is actually handling the levers
and pulleys, the machine often seems to be
the thing. The general administrator,
somewhat removed from this direct contact,
is better able to see it as it is&mdash;a
means to an end.</p>

<p>Hence to the chief librarian, this period
of preparation must always be a cause
of anxiety. Its cost and its duration especially
worry him. While his training
and experience do not permit him to minimize
its importance, he would like to make
it as cheap and as short as possible. The
reader wants his book, and he wants it
now&mdash;as soon as he sees the notice of it
in the paper. The departments of the library
that have to do with its preparation
are anxious only that this preparation
shall be thorough, realizing that on it
depends the usefulness of the book in the
second, or public, period of its life. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
impatient reader sees no reason for any
delay. The co-operating departments see
every reason. The librarian sees the reasons,
too, but it is his business, to a certain
extent, to take the reader's part, and insist
that the book's preparation shall not
be so thorough that by the time of its
completion two-thirds of the necessity for
any preparation at all shall have passed,
never to return.</p>

<p>It therefore becomes an important part
of his duty to hurry up the work of preparation,
and it is my experience that this
duty becomes difficult of performance,
wellnigh impossible, when the work and
responsibility of preparation devolves upon
two or more departments. It has sometimes
seemed to me that a majority of my
working hours were occupied in settling
disputes between the order and catalog
departments, in futile endeavors to fit the
responsibility for delays upon one or the
other and to decide which of them, and
when, was telling the truth about the
other. It was thus with a feeling of relief,
although somewhat of surprise, that I
found myself four years ago at the head
of a library where the preparatory stage
of the book's life is entirely in charge of
one department, a plan involving of course
the consolidation of the order and catalog
work.</p>

<p>My four years' experience has convinced
me that in many cases this plan may be
the solution of some of the librarian's
problems. It does not do away with delay:
it does not make the library staff assume
the reader's point of view, or even the
librarian's; but it does reduce the number
of department heads with whom the librarian
has to deal in his "hurry-up" campaign,
and it does unify a responsibility
whose division continually causes him
trouble and vexation. That we so seldom
see the combination of this work arises
from the fact that the various stages of
the book's preparation are rarely looked
upon as parts of a whole. The ordering of
books is regarded as a business in itself,
requiring its own kind of expert knowledge
and completed when the book has been delivered
and the bills checked off. The
cataloger, again, is proud of the degree of
technical perfection to which he has
brought the multiplicity of detail in his
work. He has a high sense of its necessity
in the library's scheme. Few see that both
these processes, together with mechanical
operations of pasting, labelling and lettering
on which everyone looks down, are
simply stages in the work of preparation,
through which a book must pass before it
becomes an integral part of a modern library.
These are not separate departments
of work, one completed before the
next is begun; they are interwoven and
interdependent in all sorts of ways. Books
can not be ordered properly without a catalog.
Books can not be cataloged properly
without information necessary in the
operation of ordering. It becomes a question
of library policy, then, whether these
operations may not be combined, and the
considerations adduced above form at least
a strong argument for such combination.</p>

<p>I have purposely dwelt on this matter
from the standpoint of a general administrator
and have therefore not gone into
details, which it will be easy for you to
obtain if you desire them.</p>

<p>In closing, let me say that I believe
catalogers to have in a high degree that
devotion to their task and that skill and
interest in working out its details, that
have made the American public library
what it is. What they need to guard
against is the aloofness arising from the
separate and technical character of that
work. Many of them realize, and all of
them should do so, the fact that the catalog
is made for the reader; not the reader
for the catalog. We may try to train our
readers to use our catalogs, but to the end
of time we shall still have to deal with the
unintelligent, the careless and the captious,
and we must try to adapt our catalogs
more or less to them. The cataloger
may have to break cherished rules, to
throw tradition overboard, to act in many
ways that will scandalize his profession.
Contact with as many other departments of
the library as possible&mdash;realization of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
position as a cog wheel in contact with
other cogs, will help on the good work.</p>

<p>The following paper written by Miss
BEATRICE WINSER, of the Newark free
public library, was read in her absence by
Miss Agnes Van Valkenburgh, of the library
school of the New York public library:</p>


<h3>THE RELATION OF THE CATALOG DEPARTMENT
TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS
IN THE LIBRARY</h3>

<p>The subject assigned to me is the relation
of the catalog department to other departments
in a library. There is a feeling
abroad that it is the tendency of librarians
to consider their catalog departments as
things apart, the details of whose management,
long ago settled by experts, should
be modified only as those experts may suggest.</p>

<p>Probably chief librarians do not have
the habit of refraining from giving frequent
and careful examinations in the catalog
departments, or have less interest in
the improvement of those departments
than in others; but, because it has been
possible for experts to formulate rules, as
it has not been possible for anyone to do
for other branches of the work, the chief
librarians have quite naturally allowed
themselves to pay less and less attention
to the details of these departments, which
have thus lost the stimulus which the chief
librarians give to the departments with
which they largely concern themselves.</p>

<p>This, naturally, as I have already said,
tends to make of the cataloging department
a thing apart and much efficiency is
lost to the library as a whole because
of it.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this paper I propose
to include in the scope of the cataloging
department much of the work on
books from their selection to their placing
on the shelf.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that I am
speaking of public libraries and not of college,
historical, scientific or special libraries
of any kind, and that I am making
suggestions only.</p>


<h4>Book Selection</h4>

<p>The selection of books instead of being
a difficult and complicated matter calling
for hours of study and conference, is really
quite simple. Every librarian should expect
his more intelligent assistants to
make suggestions and help to keep his or
her own collection up to date, but final decisions
as to purchase should rest in the
hands of two or three only. An attempt
to let a dozen or more people discuss at
meetings the value of any book or books
and the propriety of adding this or that to
the library costs enormously in time and
money, and serves no useful purpose.</p>

<p>It improves the quality of the books selected
but little, it tends to develop undue
caution and to make the choice too literary
and, if it helps to educate the assistants,
it does so at too great a cost. The desire
is often expressed that a library should
contain "a well-rounded, well-balanced
collection of books." This phrase sounds
well and perhaps impresses the trustees
or the town, but what does it really mean?
Were we to follow it to its logical conclusion
we would all buy in certain fixed proportions,
all kinds of books and while we
might then lay claim that we had a well-balanced
collection, we would be far from
filling well the special needs of any special
community in which we might be placed.
In point of fact every library buys what it
thinks it needs most, in most cases it will
be found that the books selected are the
best books for that library. Most books
buy themselves, others cry out to be selected.
The clientele is waiting for them.
The small remnant of specially chosen
books call for no elaborate conferences.
Why have any system of recording the fact
that you did not buy certain books at this
time, since next month or next year the
book not bought has been displaced by
another? Besides, you can always discover
from your bibliographical aids the books
you have been compelled to miss, so why
duplicate the work already done for you?</p>

<p>Now let us look at the purely clerical
side of book ordering. Do we fill out an
elaborate order slip with all sorts of bibli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>ographical
data needed for comparatively
few books only? All that is really needed
by bookseller and library is the author,
title and publisher of a book, and the latter
even could be omitted in most cases.</p>

<p>Do we economize time and labor by
writing our orders so that with the aid
of carbon paper, we have an order slip to
file, one to send to the bookdealer and
another to the Library of Congress for the
purchase of cards?</p>

<p>When a consignment of books arrives
do we have some elaborate system of
checking it off the bill? Do we use cabalistic
signs in our books so that the public
may not by any chance discover the price
of them? Or do we simply write in plain
sight the price, source and date of the
bill in each book, check the book on the
bill and pass it on?</p>

<p>Have we ever tried the experiment with
say the Fiction Class of not giving either
price, source and date of bill in the books?</p>

<p>Suppose we buy all our novels from one
bookseller, as most libraries do, and announce
to the staff generally and also drop
a card into the official catalog and the
shelf-list to the effect, that after such or
such a date, neither the source nor price
will be found in any novel, as everyone
knows that all novels are bought from John
Smith and cost $1.00. Think of the time
saved! I am willing to wager that no
library could report any ill effects from
this change.</p>

<p>As to the few novels which sell at net
prices, the money lost in charging the
usual rate of $1.00 is negligible compared
with the time saved in making these unnecessary
entries. To comfort the super-conscientious
librarian the loss would actually
be covered in many cases, because
the reprints of novels often cost less than
$1.00.</p>


<h4>Accession Record</h4>

<p>Now let us go on to the accession book
and ask how many use the regular or the
condensed book and why?</p>

<p>Do you cling to the theory that it is
the one complete record of every book in
your library and would be most useful in
case of adjustment of fire losses? I can't
deny that it is a complete record of every
book, but of what use is that to the library?</p>

<p>As to the adjustment of fire losses, are
the books in your library arranged in accession
order so that in case of fire you
could show the insurance adjusters which
books were burned by referring to your
accession books?</p>

<p>Do you claim that the accession number
is still necessary so that you may know
the number of books added and to help distinguish
one copy of a book from another?
Why not use the Bates numbering
stamp as an automatically accurate recording
device, and save time and money?
Do you use the accession book for securing
each month the number of books added in
any one class, which of course the Bates
numbering stamp can not give?</p>

<p>To get this one record we employ the
time of a person in making other useless
records, when all we need is a blank book
in which we enter in a few minutes all
books under date and class number. In
the same book we enter in another place
the books subdivided under heads of purchase,
binding, periodicals and gifts. Thus
at tremendous saving we can answer at
once the question of how many books
are added during any month and in what
class.</p>

<p>Do you perhaps keep an accession book,
so that you may secure the price and
source of a book reported lost by a borrower?
How much lost motion, to say
nothing of time and money, is expended
annually in libraries where assistants turn
from their shelf-list to their accession book
for these facts which should be given on
the shelf-list card!</p>


<h4>Classification</h4>

<p>Have you ever thought how much it
costs your library to have it classified by
a college and library school bred person?
I am using these terms as synonymous
with an educated person. Have you ever
noticed how much time she spends in getting
a book into what to her is the exact
class and place?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Now I am not arguing for less educated
people in our public libraries, far from
it, but I wish to call your attention to
the amount of time and money expended
by you in too minute and particular classification.
Have you ever thought that quite
a coarse classification is just as good for
your library as the rather particular one
which causes your head cataloger to spend
half an hour over a book which might
just as well be made ready in five minutes?</p>

<p>Often, after much time has been spent in
debating this point or that, about some
special feature of a book, and it has at
last been placed in a certain division, it
will be found more useful with its fellows
in a coarser or broader division.</p>

<p>I am only suggesting that time could be
saved here without impairing the usefulness
of the library.</p>


<h4>Cataloging</h4>

<p>This is that division of library work
which one must approach as the holy of
holies, leaving one's shoes on the mat outside.</p>

<p>Please do not assume that I do not appreciate
what it has meant to the public
library to have experts formulate a set of
rules which any library can use. I am
not objecting to the rules, but to the application
of the rules. We spend hours,
days, months, and years in giving paging,
illustrations, size, publishers and place
of publication on our catalog cards and all
for what purpose pray?</p>

<p>What does the average user of a public
library want to know? He wants to know
whether you have a book by a certain
author, by a certain title or on a certain
subject. Ninety-five per cent of the borrowers
of books want nothing more than
that, and I am excluding fiction entirely.
Consequently for the possible five per cent,
and that is a high percentage, you spend
much time in giving gratuitous information.
The man who knows his subject
goes to the bibliographies of the subject
and does not depend upon your card catalog
for bibliographical information. Let
us look into these valuable items, aside
from the very necessary author and title,
supplied on catalog cards.</p>

<p>Paging. Did your reference people ever
report any need of it in serving the public?
I never heard of such need.</p>

<p>Place of publication and publisher. Both
these items are occasionally asked for, but
why spend time in putting them on all your
cards for the sake of the few who wish
to know, since you can immediately refer
to Books in Print for current books and
for all others to the many aids published
for the librarian.</p>

<p>The date. Well, I might grant that it
serves a better purpose than the other
items, but I doubt its great usefulness.</p>

<p>Do you in addition to the very necessary
shelf-list for all the books in the library,
have a special shelf-list for Branches?
Have you ever thought of the time given
to keep the record of all the books at
your Branches?</p>

<p>What purpose does it serve, since your
Branches have their own record of the
books they have?</p>

<p>I know of one library which kept such
a record and finally decided to give it up,
since it cost a great deal of money, and
seemed after careful consideration to be
of little value. Not the least harm has resulted
from the change and the cataloging
department has almost forgotten that it
was ever done.</p>

<p>Does the head cataloger work at least
one day a week in the lending or reference
department for the sake of getting
away from her own point of view and to
imbibe something of the real needs of
public and assistants? Try it, even if you
think you can't afford it and I venture to
prognosticate that your cataloging department
from being the seat of the learned
and superior will become a really valuable
aid to all the other departments.</p>

<p>Within the limits of my paper I have
been able to cite only a few examples of
the changes which might be made in the
method of putting books on the shelf in
most of our public libraries, but I hope
that the very obvious things I have said
may serve to help in simplifying the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
of a profession already much overburdened
with technique.</p>

<p>The fourth paper in the discussion by
Miss LAURA SMITH, of the Cincinnati
public library, was entitled:</p>


<h3>ADMINISTRATION OF A CATALOG DEPARTMENT
FROM A CATALOGER'S
POINT OF VIEW</h3>

<p>The ideal of the modern library is service
to the community, but the tendency has
been to estimate this service by statistics
as printed in library reports. Columns of
figures, showing the number of books cataloged
and the cards made, represent but
a small part of what can be done and
should not be taken as a measure of value
of the cataloging department to the library
patrons. The old idea of the library was
the omniscient librarian who served all
the readers from his store of knowledge,
but the development of the modern library
movement, bringing an increased
patronage, made it necessary to delegate
some of this work, and libraries were
set off into departments. Gradually mechanical
appliances were introduced and
personal aid was limited to the favored
few while the average reader was helpless
in the face of machinery whose workings
were a mystery to him. It reminds one of
the story of the fine hospital donated by
a philanthropic citizen to a thriving town
of the middle west. The building was a
model of hospital architecture, the furnishings
were the most modern obtainable
and the institution was ideal in every respect,
adjudged by experts the latest thing
in hospitals. A poor citizen, foreign by
birth, took his wife to this hospital for
treatment. The next day he went to
inquire for her and was told that she was
too ill to see him, but the attendant offered
to take him through the building
and show him all the modern improvements.
The man was interested and followed
his guide through the various
wards, listening attentively to his lecture
on the advantages of the latest improvements
in hospital service. The second
day he returned to learn the progress of
his wife's case, but she was still too ill
to see him, so the attendant showed him
some more improvements, which he had
not seen the day before. The man was
greatly impressed. The third day he returned
and was told that his wife had died.
When asked by a friend what disease had
ended her life, he replied, "I don't know,
unless it was the improvements." So the
library has adopted progressive methods
and among other improvements it has
walled a room with the latest model of
catalog trays filled with cards as silent
guides to the collection of books. Printed
signs, which no one reads, give intricate
directions as to the use of this monster;
a human assistant is rarely in sight. Has
the library the right to expect the public to
know how to use a catalog? A trained
assistant should be stationed here, and
who are better qualified for this service
than the members of the cataloging staff?
At this point is one of the opportunities
for the cataloger's most efficient service to
the community.</p>

<p>The chief requisite of a well-organized
catalog department is a corps of intelligent,
educated, trained assistants who have had
several years' experience. The raw recruit
from the library school is an expense
to the service because library school graduates
find difficulty in adapting themselves
to the existing methods of most libraries.
This fault is sometimes individual but more
often it is due to the different methods
of cataloging taught in the various schools.
There should be uniformity of method on
this point, full cataloging should be taught
in all the schools because it is far easier
for the cataloger to learn omissions than
to acquire a knowledge of full cataloging
when the short form only has been taught
in the school. Subject-heading work can
be taught only in a general way. Years
of experience are needed before an assistant
is competent to assign subject headings,
therefore a constantly changing staff
is an item of expense worthy of serious consideration.
Subject headings might be in
the hands of a few assistants but there is
advantage in having the views of many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
minds under the supervision of one reviser.</p>

<p>An understanding of the community and
of existing conditions within the library,
added to a thoroughly assimilated knowledge
of cataloging methods, increases the
value of an assistant. Changes are usually
due to small salaries, and to better financial
conditions elsewhere, but adding a reasonable
amount to the salary of a competent
assistant is a good investment. To
be sure, it foots up on the pay roll as a
larger outlay than the substitution of a less
experienced assistant at the same or a
smaller salary. What the pay roll tells,
however, is not borne out by the facts because
on it there is no financial accounting
for the time of the administrator of
the department which is consumed in
breaking in a new cataloger while the
more important things wait, or go by default.
Positions in the cataloging department
should yield a financial return sufficient
to make their incumbency more or
less permanent for it is possible to accomplish
more with a smaller staff of experienced
assistants than with a larger number
of those new to the business.</p>

<p>When the library has gathered together
the best staff of catalogers it can afford
it should not put them, like a collection
of expensive bric-a-brac, behind closed
doors with only the regulation catalogers'
tools as guides, and expect them to yield
the best return on the investment. The
best cataloger needs the stimulus of personal
contact with the public as an aid to
the most intelligent work. When the cataloging
department has a sufficient number
of well-trained, experienced assistants, a
schedule of work which permits direct contact
with the public for at least one-third
of the time and a system of co-operation
between departments with freedom from
unnecessary interruptions to the routine as
planned, the catalog is a labor saving tool
reducing the net cost of production by the
time saved to the circulating and reference
departments.</p>

<p>The cataloging for a large library system
should be done at the central library
for several reasons. The main cataloging
offices are there with the collection of
reference books and the official files showing
what headings and entries have been
used. The expert catalogers and revisers
are better fitted for the responsibility of
the cataloging than the assistants at the
branches, distracted by other work. The
enormous number of cards necessary for
the various catalogs are more economically
duplicated by writer press, or multigraph,
than by hand or typewriter because time is
saved in this way in the actual making of
the cards, in numbering and putting titles
on printed cards and in proof reading, or
revising, for in revising typewritten cards,
each card must be carefully scrutinized,
while from the writer press only the first
copy needs revision. When copies of the
same title are to be purchased for several
branches, the cost of cataloging is greatly
reduced if all the copies reach the cataloging
department together as time is thus
saved in all the processes of preparing
the books for circulation, from the accessioning
to the pasting of the labels. In
the case of fiction this is always possible
but with other classes, while it is not always
expedient to purchase for the main
library and the branches simultaneously,
the branch librarians and order department
can simplify the process by prompt
decision as to the number of branches to
which titles are to be added, so that all
cards may be ordered or made at the
same time. By this means one order for
printed cards and one setting up of copy
for writer press or multigraph is sufficient.
When books come to the catalog department
singly and at odd times the labor
of verifying author entries and subject
headings is the same as for new titles, and
the making of cards becomes a mechanical
process only when they are to be made
in large quantities. Every branch added to
the library system increases the work of
the cataloging department, a fact often lost
sight of by the chief administrators of a
library. There seems to be a popular delusion
that each new addition to the library
family means only a duplication of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
cards while the fact remains that most of
the processes in the routine practically
consume as much time and thought as if
the title in hand were new in the library.
In the case of shelf-listing it is obviously
easier and takes less time to make a brand
new shelf-list card for a book than it does
to withdraw the card from the shelf-list,
make an addition to it and refile the card.</p>

<p>If the main building is so arranged that
one card catalog can be used conveniently
by all departments much expense will be
saved. But if there must be department
catalogs, author and subject entries should
be uniform so that the individual catalogs
may be simply duplicates of certain divisions
of the general catalog. Subject headings
in the public library should be simple
enough to be within the comprehension
of the average reader. To simplify headings
for children is a useless expense and
an insult to the child who is often more
intelligent than many adult readers. The
public library being "an integral part of
public education" should not be guilty of
senseless simplification even though the
kindergartners may accuse us of "taking
away the joy of childhood." If the so-called
simplified headings are used they
can not be filed with other headings, therefore
two separate catalogs in each branch
must be maintained at extra expense.</p>

<p>All non-essentials should be eliminated
from the mechanical processes of preparing
books for the shelves. The time of
high-priced service should be used for the
scholarly work, duplication of cards and
routine clerical work do not require a college
education nor library school training.
Printed cards should be purchased whenever
possible. It is not necessary to become
hysterical over the superfluity of information
on some of the Library of Congress
cards because the average user of
a catalog in a public library does not read
beyond the first line of the title, and therefore
is not confused by bibliographical details.
On the other hand, this same detail
is valuable to the few readers who
need it. Another groundless objection to
the use of these cards is the statement
that books must be held until the cards
are received. If there is co-operation between
the order and the cataloging departments,
books and cards may be ordered
and will come to the cataloger about the
same time. When they do not the books
should be sent through on temporary slips.
This adds slightly to the cost of handling,
but saves the reputation of the library in
the circulating department. The printed
card should be accepted when it agrees
with the title page, but when the card requires
changes which mar its appearance it
should be rejected. When the cards must
be made by the individual library the extra
bibliographical detail should be omitted for
purposes of economy, and the catalogs
would still be uniform and accurate in
essentials. Entries must be accurate, uniform
and as consistent as possible that the
catalog may save the time of the reference
librarians, since effective reference
work can be done only when the library
is well classified and cataloged and quick
service is possible only under these conditions.</p>

<p>The plan to combine the catalog and
reference departments, the assistants working
one-third of their time in reference
work, brings excellent results. In the first
place the assistants come in direct contact
with the public for part of every day.
The knowledge of books gained by examination
for full cataloging can be made
directly useful to the public. On the other
hand, the demands of the reader, his peculiarities
of expression and his general
attitude toward the library give inspiration
to the work in the cataloging department
as to subject headings and analyticals
to be made. The change of work is
restful and enables the assistants to accomplish
much in a day without becoming
weary of either line of work. The efficiency
of the assistants depends upon their
ability to bring the book and the reader
together and as the cataloger has the advantage
of studying the books she should
therefore bring this knowledge to the public
through personal contact.</p>

<p>Emphasis is put on the increased useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>ness
of the staff by reason of the ability
to appreciate the relation between the library
and the public and to bring into the
daily life of the community the increased
knowledge of books.</p>

<p>What has been said is not intended as a
criticism of any method of administering
a cataloging department, but is an effort
rather to present a plan which from practical
experience has proved successful.</p>

<p>The discussion was then thrown open
to the floor, with the suggestion from
the chairman that it take the following
lines:</p>

<p>1. Is the catalog department too confined
in its organization and too distinctly
separated from other departments?</p>

<p>2. How much mechanical work should
be done by expert catalogers? Who should
do the mechanical work and where should
it be done?</p>

<p>3. What should be the relations between
the catalog and the shipping departments?</p>

<p>Mr. Hodges, of the Cincinnati public library,
said that each library had to use
a system suited to its individual needs,
that in Cincinnati there was no head
of the order department, that he considered
the use of catalogers in the reference
department during rush hours a good
plan as they were usually well fitted for
the work, that in his library there was
a single head of the catalog and reference
departments.</p>

<p>Miss Hitchler, superintendent of cataloging
of the Brooklyn public library, said
that co-operation could be effected between
departments without interchange of assistants.</p>

<p>Mr. Hopper said that the obstacle to
combining the heads of the catalog and
order departments in one person was that
a knowledge of cataloging and a knowledge
of the book trade were seldom combined
in one person.</p>

<p>During the discussion of the second point&mdash;that
of scientific management within the
department&mdash;Miss Van Valkenburgh raised
a laugh by inquiring where we are to draw
the line in keeping track of our efficiency.</p>

<p>Mr. Martel, of the Library of Congress,
in answer to the charge made against catalogers
of over-elaboration, as for example
in the matter of periodical records, said
that under-elaboration often proved quite
as expensive as over-elaboration.</p>

<h2>SECOND SESSION</h2>


<p class="center">Friday, June 29.</p>

<p>The second session of the Catalog Section
was held on Friday afternoon, June
29, Miss Gooch presiding.</p>

<p>Miss Van Valkenburgh, Miss Hiss, and
Miss Dame, were appointed as nominating
committee by the Chairman.</p>

<p>The session took the form of an informal
discussion on simplified forms of typewritten
catalog cards, and was held at the
desire of the committee of the Professional
Training Section on uniformity of forms
of catalog cards. This committee was appointed
in January, 1912, and consists of
Helen Turvill, Chairman, Agnes Van Valkenburgh,
Harriet B. Gooch.</p>

<p>The Chairman directed the discussion
by taking up point by point the form of
card recommended by the committee for
the practice work of the library schools.
Typewritten cards for a public library of
about 50,000 volumes, to be filed with L.
C. cards, were taken as a basis of discussion.</p>

<p>Among the details considered were the
following, with the decisions which seemed
most generally favored by those present:</p>

<p><b>Brackets.</b> Omit brackets for material inserted
in heading but use in title and imprint.</p>

<p><b>Initial article.</b> Use initial article, unless
including it would entail repeating author's
name in the title.</p>

<p><b>Initial possessive.</b> Omit author's name
in the possessive case at the beginning
of a title, and cancel it when used on L.
C. cards.</p>

<p><b>Editor, etc.</b> In the title use the name
of the editor, translator, etc., in the form
given on the title page.</p>

<p><b>Imprint.</b> Include place, publisher and
date of publication together with inclusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
copyright dates if they differ from the
date of publication.</p>

<p><b>Collation.</b> Give main paging, illus.,
ports., maps. Give size only if unusual.</p>

<p><b>Position of items.</b> Begin collation on a
new line and indent.</p>

<p><b>Secondary cards.</b> Give author and title
only on secondary cards. (Main subject
cards are not considered secondary cards.)</p>

<p>Other details discussed were use of
points of omission, form of series note,
tracing cards, headings in joint-author entries,
the place for paging in an analytical
note, entry under pseudonym versus real
name, entry for adapter.</p>

<p>At the close of the foregoing discussion,
the matter of having a permanent A. L. A.
committee on cataloging was brought forward,
and upon Miss Van Valkenburgh's
motion, it was determined to request the
Executive Board of the A. L. A. to appoint
a permanent catalog committee to which
questions in cataloging may be referred
for recommendation.</p>

<p>Miss Sutliff then suggested that an A.
L. A. code of alphabetizing would also
be welcome. Mr. Martel, in response to a
question by the Chairman, said that the
Library of Congress followed the Cutter
Rules, but had working notes that might
be helpful.</p>

<p>A motion put by Mr. Keogh was then
passed that the Executive Board of the
A. L. A. be asked to send a request to the
Librarian of Congress to furnish the code
of alphabetizing used in the Library of Congress
for publication.</p>

<p>An amendment to the foregoing to include
the words "with changes for small
libraries" failed of passage.</p>

<p>The nominating committee then submitted
its ticket: Chairman, Charles Martel,
Chief of the Catalog Division, Library of
Congress; Secretary, Edith P. Bucknam,
Chief of the Cataloging Department,
Queens Borough public library.</p>

<p>After the election, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h2>SECTION ON LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN</h2>


<h3>FIRST SESSION</h3>

<p>The first session of the Section on Library
Work with Children was held in the
ballroom of the Hotel Kaaterskill, at 2:30
p. m., June 24th, with the Chairman, Miss
Power, in the chair. In the absence of Miss
Lawrence, Miss Ida Duff acted as secretary.</p>

<p>Two papers on the subject of "Values in
library work with children" were read; the
first by Miss CLARA W. HUNT, superintendent
of the children's department,
Brooklyn public library.</p>


<h3>VALUES IN LIBRARY WORK WITH
CHILDREN&mdash;I</h3>

<p>You are probably familiar with the story
of the man who, being asked by his host
which part of the chicken he liked best replied
that "he'd never had a chance to
find out; that when he was a boy it was
the fashion to give the grown people first
choice, and by the time he'd grown up the
children had the pick, so he'd never tasted
anything but the drumstick."</p>

<p>It will doubtless be looked upon as heresy
for a children's librarian to own that she
has a deal of sympathy for the down-trodden
adult of the present; that there have
been moments when she has even gone so
far as to say an "amen"&mdash;under her breath&mdash;to
the librarian who, after a day of vexations
at the hands of the exasperating
young person represented in our current
social writings as a much-sinned-against
innocent, wrathfully exploded, "Children
ought to be put in a barrel and fed through
the bung till they are twenty-one years
old!"</p>

<p>During the scant quarter century which
has seen the birth and marvelous growth
of modern library work with children, the
"new education" has been putting its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
stamp upon the youth of America and upon
the ideas of their parents regarding
the upbringing of children. And it has
come to pass that one must be very bold
to venture to brush off the dust of disuse
from certain old saws and educational truisms,
such as "All play and no work make
Jack a mere toy," "No gains without
pains," "We learn to do by doing," "Train
up a child in the way he should go," and
so on.</p>

<p>Our kindergartens, our playground agitators,
our juvenile courts, our child welfare
exhibits are so persistently&mdash;and
rightly&mdash;showing the wrongdoing child as
the helpless victim of heredity and environment
that hasty thinkers are jumping
to the conclusion that, since a child is not
to blame for his thieving tendencies, it
is our duty, rather than punish, to let him
go on stealing; since it is a natural instinct
for a boy to like the sound of crashing
glass and the exercise of skill needed to
hit a mark, we must not reprove him for
throwing stones at windows; because a
child does not like to work, we should let
him play&mdash;play all the time.</p>

<p>The painless methods of the new education,
which tend to make life too soft for
children, and to lead parents to believe
that everything a child craves he must
have, these tendencies have had their
effect upon the production and distribution
of juvenile books, and have added to the
librarian's task the necessity not only of
fighting against the worst reading, but
against the third rate lest it crowd out
the best.</p>

<p>It is the importance of this latter warfare
which I wish mainly to discuss.</p>

<p>We children's librarians, in the past fifteen
or twenty years, have had to take a
good many knocks, more or less facetious,
from spectators of the sterner sex who
are worried about the "feminization of
the library," and who declare that no
woman, certainly no spinster, can possibly
understand the nature of the boy. Perhaps
sometimes we are inclined to droop apologetic
heads, because we know that some
women are sentimental, that they don't
all "look at things in the large," as men
invariably do. In view, however, of the
record of this youthful movement of ours,
we have a right rather to swagger than
to apologize.</p>

<p>The influence of the children's libraries
upon the ideals, the tastes, the occupations,
the amusements, the language, the
manners, the home standards, the choice of
careers, upon the whole life, in fact, of
thousands upon thousands of boys and girls
has been beyond all count as a civic force
in America.</p>

<p>And yet, while teachers tell us that the
opening of every new library witnesses a
substitution of wholesome books for "yellow"
novels in pupils' hands; while men
in their prime remark their infrequent
sight of the sensational periodicals left
on every doorstep twenty years ago; while
publishers of children's books are trying
to give us a clean, safe juvenile literature,
and while some nickel novel publishers
are even admitting a decline in the sale
of their wares; in spite of these evidences
of success, a warfare is still on, though its
character is changing.</p>

<p>Every librarian who has examined children's
books for a few years back knows
exactly what to expect when she tackles
the "juveniles" of 1913.</p>

<p>There will be a generous number of
books so fine in point of matter and make-up
that we shall lament having been born
too late to read these in our childhood.
The information and the taste acquired by
children who have read the best juvenile
publications of the past ten years is perfectly
amazing, and those extremists who
decry the buying of any books especially
written for children are nearly as nonsensical
as the ones who would buy everything
the child wishes.</p>

<p>But when one has selected with satisfaction
perhaps a hundred and fifty titles,
one begins to get into the potboiler class&mdash;the
written-to-order information book
which may be guaranteed to kill all future
interest in a subject treated in style so
wooden and lifeless; the retold classic in
which every semblance to the spirit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
original is lost, and the reading of which
will give to the child that familiarity which
will breed contempt for the work itself;
the atrocious picture book modeled after
the comic supplement and telling in hideous
daubs of color and caricature of line
the tale of the practical joker who torments
animals, mocks at physical deformities,
plays tricks on parents, teases the
newly-wed, ridicules good manners, whose
whole aim, in short, is to provoke guffaws
of laughter at the expense of someone's
hurt body or spirit. There will be collections
of folk and fairy tales, raked together
without discrimination from the literature
of people among whom trickery and cunning
are the most admired qualities; there
will be school stories in which the masters
and studious boys grovel at the feet of the
football hero; in greater number than the
above will be the stories written in series
on thoroughly up-to-date subjects.</p>

<p>I shall be much surprised if we do not
learn this fall that the world has been
deceived in supposing that to Amundsen
and Scott belong the honor of finding the
South Pole, or to Gen. Goethals the credit
of engineering the Panama Canal. If we
do not discover that some young Frank
or Jack or Bill was the brains behind these
achievements, I shall wonder what has
become of the ingenuity of the plotter of
the series stories&mdash;the "plotter" I say advisedly,
for it is a known fact that many
of these stories are first outlined by a
writer whose name makes books sell, the
outlines then being filled in by a company
of underlings who literally write to order.
When we learn, also, that an author who
writes admirable stories, in which special
emphasis is laid upon fair play and a sense
of honor, is at the same time writing under
another name books he is ashamed to acknowledge,
we are not surprised at the low
grade of the resulting stories.</p>

<p>With the above extremes of good and
poor there will be quantities on the border
line, books not distinctly harmful from one
standpoint&mdash;in fact, they will busily preach
honesty and pluck and refinement, etc.,
but they will be so lacking in imagination
and power, in the positive qualities that go
to make a fine book, that they cannot be
called wholly harmless, since that which
crowds out a better thing is harmful, at
least to the extent that it usurps the room
of the good.</p>

<p>These books we will be urged to buy in
large duplicate, and when we, holding to
the ideal of the library as an educational
force, refuse to supply this intellectual
pap, well-to-do parents may be counted
upon to present the same in quantities
sufficient to weaken the mental digestion
of their offspring beyond cure by teachers
the most gifted.</p>

<p>There are two principal arguments&mdash;so-called&mdash;hurled
at every librarian who tries
to maintain a high standard of book selection.
One is the "I read them when I was
a child and they did me no harm" claim;
the other, based upon the doggedly clung-to
notion that our ideal of manhood is a
grown-up Fauntleroy, infers that every
book rejected was offensive to the children's
librarian because of qualities dangerously
likely to encourage the boy in a
taste for bloodshed and dirty hands.</p>

<p>Now, in this day when parents are frantically
protecting their children from the
deadly house fly, the mosquito, the common
drinking cup and towel; when milk
must be sterilized and water boiled and
adenoids removed; when the young father
solemnly bows to the dictum that he
mustn't rock nor trot his own baby&mdash;isn't it
really matter for the joke column to hear
the "did me no harm" idea advanced as an
argument? And yet it is so offered by the
same individual who, though he has survived
a boyhood of mosquito bites and
school drinking cups, refuses to allow his
child to risk what he now knows to be a
possible carrier of disease.</p>

<p>The "what was good enough for me is
good enough for my children" idea, if
soberly treated as an argument in other
matters of life, would mean death to all
progress, and it is no more to be treated
seriously as a reason for buying poor juvenile
books than a contention for the fetich
doctor versus the modern surgeon, or for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
the return to the foot messenger in place
of electrical communication.</p>

<p>It would be tactless, if not positively dangerous,
if we children's librarians openly
expressed our views when certain people
point boastfully to themselves as shining
products of mediocre story book childhoods.
So I would hastily suppress this
thought, and instead remind these people
that, as a vigorous child is immune from
disease germs which attack a delicate one,
so unquestionably have thousands of mental
and moral weaklings been retarded
from their best development by books that
left no mark on healthy children. In spite
of the probability that there are today
alive many able-bodied men who cut their
first teeth on pickles and pork chops, we
do not question society's duty to disseminate
proper ideas on the care and feeding
of children.</p>

<p>Isn't it about time that we nailed down
the lid of the coffin on the "did me no
harm" argument and buried the same in
the depths of the sea?</p>

<p>Another notion that dies hard is one
assuming that, since the children's librarian
is a woman, prone to turn white about
the gills at the sight of blood&mdash;or a mouse&mdash;she
can not possibly enter into the feelings
of the ancestral barbarian surviving
in the young human breast, but must try
to hasten the child's development to twentieth
century civilization by eliminating
the elemental and savage from his story
books.</p>

<p>If those who grow hoarse shouting the
above would take the trouble to examine
the lists of an up-to-date library they
might blush for their shallowness, that
they have been basing their opinions on
their memory of library lists at least twenty-five
years old.</p>

<p>We do not believe that womanly women
and manly men are most successfully made
by way of silly, shoddy, sorry-for-themselves
girlhoods, or lying, swaggering, loafing
boyhoods; and it is the empty, the vulgar,
the cheap, smart, trust-to-luck story,
rather than the gory one, that we dislike.</p>

<p>I am coming to the statement of what
I believe to be the problem most demanding
our study today. It is, briefly, the problem
of the mediocre book, its enormous
and ever-increasing volume. More fully
stated it is the problem of the negatively
as the enemy of the positively good; of the
cultivation of brain laziness by "thoughts-made-easy"
reading. It is a republic's, a
public school problem, viz.: How is it possible
to raise to a higher average the lowest,
without reducing to a dead level of
mediocrity the citizens of superior possibilities?
Our relation to publisher and
parent, to the library's adult open shelves
of current fiction enter into the problem.
The children's over-reading, and their reluctance
to "graduate" from juvenile books,
these and many other perplexing questions
grow out of the main one.</p>

<p>I said awhile ago that the new education
has had a tendency to make life too
soft for children, and to give to their parents
the belief that natural instincts alone
are safe guides to follow in rearing a child.
I hope I shall not seem to be a good old
times croaker, sighing for the days when
school gardens and folk dancing and glee
clubs and dramatization of lessons and
beautiful textbooks and fascinating handicraft
and a hundred other delightful things
were undreamed-of ways of making pleasant
the paths of learning. Heaven forbid
that I should join the ranks of those who
carp at a body of citizens who, at an average
wage in America less than that of the
coal miner and the factory worker, have
produced in their schools results little
short of the miraculous. To visit, as I
have, classrooms of children born in slums
across the sea, transplanted to tenements
in New York, and to see what our public
school teachers are making of these children&mdash;the
backward, the underfed, the "incorrigible,"
the blind, the an&aelig;mic&mdash;well, all
I can say is, I do not recommend these
visits to Americans of the stripe of that
boastful citizen who, being shown the
crater of Vesuvius with a "There, you
haven't anything like that in America!"
disdainfully replied, "Naw, but we've got
Niagara, and that'd put the whole blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
thing out!" For myself I never feel quite
so disposed to brag of my Americanism as
when I visit some of our New York schools.</p>

<p>And yet, watching the bored shrug of
the bright, well-born high school child
when one suggests that "The prince and
the pauper" is quite as interesting a story
as the seventh volume of her latest series,
a librarian has some feelings about the
lines-of-least-resistance method of educating
our youth, which she is glad to find
voiced by some of our ablest thinkers.</p>

<p>Here is what J. P. Munroe says: "Many
of the new methods ... methods of gentle
cooing toward the child's inclinations,
of timidly placing a chair for him before
a disordered banquet of heterogeneous
studies, may produce ladylike persons, but
they will not produce men. And when
these modern methods go as far as to compel
the teacher to divide this intellectual
cake and pudding into convenient morsels
and to spoon-feed them to the child, partly
in obedience to his schoolboy cravings,
partly in conformity to a pedagogical psychology,
then the result is sure to be mental
and moral dyspepsia in a race of milksops."
How aptly "spoon-fed pudding"
characterizes whole cartloads of our current
"juveniles"!</p>

<p>Listen to President Wilson's opinion:
"To be carried along by somebody's suggestions
from the time you begin until
the time when you are thrust groping and
helpless into the world, is the very negation
of education. By the nursing process,
by the coddling process you are sapping a
race; and only loss can possibly result
except upon the part of individuals here
and there who are so intrinsically strong
that you cannot spoil them."</p>

<p>Hugo M&uuml;nsterberg is a keen observer of
the product of American schools, and contrasting
their methods with those of his
boyhood he says: "My school work was
not adjusted to botany at nine years because
I played with an herbarium, and at
twelve to physics because I indulged in
noises with home-made electric bells, and
at fifteen to Arabic, an elective which I
miss still in several high schools, even in
Brookline and Roxbury. The more my
friends and I wandered afield with our little
superficial interests and talents and
passions, the more was the straightforward
earnestness of the school our
blessing; and all that beautified and
enriched our youth, and gave to it freshness
and liveliness, would have turned out
to be our ruin, if our elders had taken it
seriously, and had formed a life's program
out of petty caprices and boyish
inclinations."</p>

<p>And Prof. M&uuml;nsterberg thrusts his finger
into what I believe to be the weakest
joint in our educational armor when he
says: "... as there is indeed a difference
whether I ask what may best suit
the taste and liking of Peter, the darling,
or whether I ask what Peter, the man, will
need for the battle of life in which nobody
asks what he likes, but where the question
is how he is liked, and how he suits the
taste of his neighbors."</p>

<p>What would become of our civilization
if we were to follow merely the instincts
and natural desires? Yet is there not in
America a tremendous tendency to the notion,
that except in matters of physical
welfare, the child's lead is to be followed
to extreme limits? Don't we librarians
feel it in the pressure brought to bear
upon us by those who fail to find certain
stories, wanted by the children, on our
shelves? "Why, that's a good book," the
parent will say, "The hero is honest and
kind, the book won't hurt him any&mdash;in fact
it will give the child some good ideas."</p>

<p>"Ideas." Yes, perhaps. There is another
educator I should like to quote, J. H.
Baker in his "Education and life": "Whatever
you would wish the child to do and
become, that let him practice. We learn
to do, not by knowing, but by knowing and
then doing. Ethical teaching, tales of heroic
deeds, soul-stirring fiction that awakens
sympathetic emotions may accomplish
but little unless in the child's early life
... the ideas and feelings find expression
in action and so become a part of the
child's power and tendency...."</p>

<p>Now we believe with G. Stanley Hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
that, "The chief enemy of active virtue in
the world is not vice but laziness, languor
and apathy of will;" that "mind work is infinitely
harder than physical toil;" that
(as another says) "all that does not rouse,
does not set him to work, rusts and taints
him ... the disease of laziness ...
destroys the whole man."</p>

<p>And when children of good heritage,
good homes, sound bodies, bright minds,
spend hours every week curled up among
cushions, allowing a stream of cambric-tea
literature gently to trickle over their
brain surfaces, we know that though the
heroes and heroines of these stories be represented
as prodigies of industry and vigor,
our young swallowers of the same are being
reduced to a pulp of brain and will laziness
that will not only make them incapable
of struggling with a page of Quentin
Durward, for example, but will affect
their moral stamina, since fighting fiber is
the price of virtue.</p>

<p>Ours is, as I have said, a public education,
a republic's problem. To quote President
Wilson again: "Our present plans for
teaching everybody involve certain unpleasant
things quite inevitably. It is obvious
that you cannot have universal education
without restricting your teaching to
such things as can be universally understood.
It is plain that you cannot impart
'university methods' to thousands, or create
'investigators' by the score, unless you
confine your university education to matters
which dull men can investigate, your
laboratory training to tasks which mere
plodding diligence and submissive patience
can compass. Yet, if you do so limit and
constrain what you teach, you thrust taste
and insight and delicacy of perception out
of the schools, exalt the obvious and merely
useful things above the things which
are only imaginatively or spiritually conceived,
make education an affair of tasting
and handling and smelling, and so create
Philistia, that country in which they speak
of 'mere literature.'"</p>

<p>In our zeal to serve the little alien, descendant
of generations of poverty and ignorance,
let us not lose sight of the importance
to our country of the child more
fortunate in birth and brains. So strong
is my feeling on the value of leaders that
I hold we should give at least as much
study to the training of the accelerate
child as we give to that of the defective.
Though I boast the land of Abraham Lincoln
and Booker Washington I do not give
up one iota of my belief that the child
who is born into a happy environment, of
parents strong in body and mind, holds the
best possibilities of making a valuable citizen;
and so I am concerned that this child
be not spoiled in the making by a training
or lack of training that fails to recognize
his possibilities.</p>

<p>It is encouraging to find growing attention
in the "Proceedings" of the N. E. A.
and other educational bodies to the problem
of the bright child who has suffered
by the lock-step system which has molded
all into conformity with the capabilities
of the average child.</p>

<p>The librarian's difficulty is perhaps
greater than that of the teacher, because
open shelves and freedom of choice are so
essential a part of our program. We must
provide easy reading for thousands of
children. Milk and water stories may have
an actual value to children whose unfavorable
heritage and environment have retarded
their mental development. But the
deplorable thing is to see young people,
mercifully saved from the above handicaps,
making a bee line for the current
diluted literature for grown-ups, (as accessible
as Scott on our open shelves) and
to realize that this taste, which is getting
a life set, is the inevitable outcome of the
habit of reading mediocre juveniles.</p>

<p>We must not rail at publishers for trying
to meet the demands of purchasers. Our
job is to influence that demand far more
than we have done as yet. Large book
jobbers tell us that millions and millions
of poor juveniles are sold in America to
thousands of the sort we librarians recommend.
I have seen purchase lists of boys'
club directors and Sunday School library
committees calling for just the weak and
empty stuff we would destroy. I have un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>wittingly
been an eavesdropper at Christmas
book counters and have heard the orders
given by parents and the suggestions
made by clerks. And I feel that the public
library has but skirmished along the outposts
while the great field of influencing
the reading of American children remains
unconquered. Until we affect production
to the extent that the book stores circulate
as good books as the best libraries
we cannot be too complacent about our
position as a force in citizen making.</p>

<p>An "impossible" ideal, of course, but far
from intimidating, the largeness of the
task makes us all the more determined.</p>

<p>This paper attempts no suggestion of
new methods of attacking the problem.
It is rather a restatement of an old perplexity.
I harp once more on a worn
theme because I think that unless we frequently
lift our eyes from the day's absorbing
duties for a look over the whole
field, and unless we once and again make
searching inventory of our convictions, our
purposes, our methods, our attainments,
we are in danger of letting ourselves slip
along the groove of the taken-for-granted
and our work loses in power as we allow
ourselves to become leaners instead of
leaders. May we not, as if it were a new
idea, rouse to the seriousness of the mediocre
habit indulged in by young people
capable of better things? Should not our
work with children reach out more to
work with adults, to those who buy and
sell and make books for the young? Is it
not time for the successful teller of stories
to children to use her gifts in audiences
of grown people, persuading these molders
of the children's future of the reasonableness
of our objection to the third rate
since it is the enemy of the best? May
it not be politic, at least, for the librarian
to descend from her disdainful height and
make friends with "the trade," with bookseller
and publisher who, after all, have
as good a right to their bread and butter
as the librarian paid out of the city's
taxes?</p>

<p>And then&mdash;is it not possible that we
might be better librarians if we refused
to be librarians every hour in the day
and half the night as well? What if we
were to have the courage to refuse to
indulge in nervous breakdowns, because
we deliberately plan to play, and to eat,
and to sleep, to keep serene and sane
and human, believing that God in His
Heaven gives His children a world of
beauty to enjoy as well as a work to do
with zeal. If we lived a little longer and
not quite so wide, the gain to our chosen
work in calm nerves and breadth of interest
and sympathy would even up for
dropping work on schedule time for a
symphony concert or a country walk or
a visit with a friend&mdash;might even justify
saving the cost of several A. L. A. conferences
toward a trip to Italy!</p>

<p>This hurling at librarians advice to play
more and work less reminds me of a story
told by a southern friend. Years ago, in
a sleepy little Virginia village, there lived
two characters familiar to the townspeople,
whose greatest daily excitement was
a stroll down to the railroad station to
watch the noon express rush through to
distant southern cities. One of these personages
was the station keeper, of dry
humor and sententious habit, whom we
will call Hen Waters; the other was the
station goat, named, of course, Billy. Year
after year had Billy peacefully cropped
the grass along the railroad tracks, turning
an indifferent ear to the roar of the
daily express, when suddenly one day the
notion seemed to strike his goatish mind
that this racket had been quietly endured
long enough. With the warning whistle
of the approaching engine, Billy, lowering
his head, darted furiously up the track,
intending to butt the offending thunderer
into Kingdom Come. When, a few seconds
later, the amazed spectators were gazing
after the diminishing train, Hen Waters,
addressing the spot where the redoubtable
goat had last been seen, drawled out:
"Billy, I admire your pluck&mdash;but darn your
discretion!"</p>

<p>The parallel between the ambitions and
the futility of the goat, and the present
speaker's late advice is so obvious that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
only the illogicalness of woman can account
for my cherishing a hope that I may
be spared the fate of the indiscreet Billy.</p>

children's work, Cleveland public library,

presenting the topic from another
viewpoint.</p>


<h3>VALUES IN LIBRARY WORK WITH
CHILDREN&mdash;II</h3>

<p>To elucidate principles of value, I shall
use, by way of illustration, the experience
and structure of a certain children's department
where the problem of children's
reading and the means of bringing books
to them has been more intensively studied
in the last nine years than was possible
there before that time. At the time we
took our last survey of the department
it was found that probably about six out
of ten of the children of the city read
library books in their homes during the
calendar year, and that each child had
read about twenty books on the average.
Four of the six procured library books
from a library center; two of the six procured
them from collections, either in their
schoolrooms or in homes in their neighborhood.
In all, fifty-four thousand children
read a million books, which reached
them through forty-three librarians assigned
for special work with these children,
through three hundred teachers and
about one hundred volunteers. Now, we
know that six out of ten children is not
an ideal proportion and that fifty-four
thousand may endanger the quality of
book influence for each child, but both of
these statements indicate conditions to
be adjusted so that the experience of each
reading child may contribute to the whole
and experience with numbers may benefit
the individual. To accomplish this end,
work with the children was given departmental
organization. My concern in this
paper is with departmental organization as
it benefits the reading child, and with the
principles and policies which have been
developed through departmental unity.</p>

<p>We think ordinarily that one who loves
books has three general hallmarks&mdash;his
reading is fairly continuous, there is permanency
of book interest, and this interest
maintained on a plane of merit. These
three results always justify the reader and
those who have influenced him, and if the
consequent book interests of the library
child were entirely such, they would prove
to all laymen, without argument, that the
principles are basic. But in the child's
contact with the library there are many
evidences of modifications of normal book
interests; for, instead of continuity of
reading, the children's rooms are overcrowded
in winter and have comparatively
small book use in summer; instead of permanency
of book interests extending over
the difficult intermediate period, we know
that large numbers of those children who
leave school before they reach high school
have little or no library contact during
their first working years and we sometimes
feel that the interesting experiences with
reading working children, which librarians
are prone to emphasize, give us an impression
of a larger number than careful investigation
would show. As for quality
of reading of the individual working child
we cannot maintain that it is always on a
high plane.</p>

<p>All these conditions we know to be
largely the result of environmental influences.
Deprived for twelve hours a day,
twelve months in a year, of opportunity for
normal youthful activities, the child's entire
physical and mental schedule is
thrown out of balance and his tendency
is to turn to reading, a recreation possible
at any time, only when there is no opportunity
to follow other avenues of interest.
The strain upon the ear and eye, and back
and brain, is even greater in the shop than
in the school, and in the consequent intense
physical fatigue the tendency is toward
recreations in which the book may
have no place. The power of the nickel
library over the child can be broken by
the presence of the public library, but no
intermediate gets away from the suggestion,
by voice and print, of the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
novel, with its present-day social interests.
Consequently the whole judgment of the
results of library work with children can
not rest upon these general tests of normal
book interests. Rather such variations
from the normal are themselves conditions
which influence the structure of
the work and especially the principles of
book presentation. If children are living
in an environment which is not the best
one for them, all the forces with which
they come in contact should tend to correct
the abnormal and give them the
things their moral nature craves&mdash;freer
and fuller thoughts, better and freer living,
truth of expression, beauty of feeling. We
must recognize that books also must be
a force in reconstructing or normalizing
the influences of their environment. Children
with social needs must have books
with social values to meet those needs&mdash;right
social contacts, true social perspective,
traditions of family and race, loveliness
of nature, companionship of living
things, right group association and group
interests.</p>

<p>But while the pedagogical and moral
values of books, that is the benefits of right
reading for children of normal life, were
fully analyzed, the children's department
of which I speak had almost no written
principle to aid in the enormous task of
determining the influence of books on children
with social needs. Appreciations of
the social relationships and the interdependence
of characters in books which
have proven themselves moving forces in
the lives of children, gained through the
testimony of men and women who know
their indebtedness to them&mdash;such books as
"Little women," "Tom Brown," "Heidi," "Otto
of the silver hand"&mdash;gave a fundamental
principle upon which to work. Books should
construct a larger social ideal for the reader
instead of confirming his present one.
Then arose this question: Should we
have books with weak social values in
the library as a concession to certain children,
or by having them do we harm
most those very children to whom we
have conceded them? The gradual solution
of this problem seems to me to be
one of the greatest services which a library
can render its children. So long as this
question is in process of solution we may
accept the following as a tentative reply:
No books weak in social ideals should be
furnished, provided we do not lose reading
children by their elimination. If such
books are the best a child will read
and we take them away, causing loss of
library reading interest, we permit him
to sink further into his environment.
With the last principle as a basis, the
evaluation of books was accomplished in
the evolution of the department. The
cumulative experience of librarians working
with children showed that many books
which lead only to others of their kind
were weak in social viewpoint, and that
such books were the ones read largely by
those children most occasional and spasmodic
in their reading. Here was a
determining point in the establishment
of standards of reading, for it brought
us face to face with the question, Shall
we consider this situation our fault since
we supply such books to children who need
something better vastly more than do
others, or shall we merely justify our
selection by maintaining that those children
will under no circumstances read a
higher grade of books? However, it was
proven at the same time that other books
were read also by children with social
limitations, which, although apparently no
better on first evaluation, lead to a better
type of reading and this gave us a fresh
impulse to consider the evaluation of books
as a constantly moving process, and
prompted the policy of the removal of
those types of books which were least influential
in developing a good reading
taste. This was done, however, with the
definite intention that an increasingly better
standard of reading must mean that no
reading children be sacrificed, an end only
possible by a fuller knowledge of the value
of the individual book to the individual
child.</p>

<p>Now let us see what changes have been
evolved in the book collections in the de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>partment
under consideration in the past
seven or eight years.</p>

<p>In the first study of the collection and
before any final study of books from the
social viewpoint had been reached, the
proportion of books of the doubtful class
to those which were standard was considered,
and it was seen that this proportion
should be decreased in order that a child's
chances for eventually reading the best
might be improved. It was obvious that
the reading of the young children should
be most carefully safeguarded, and this
was the first point of attack. As a result,
these two types of books were eliminated:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>1. All series for young children, such as
the Dotty Dimples and the Little
Colonels.</p>

<p>2. Books for young children dealing
with animal life which have neither
humane nor scientific value, such as
the Pierson and Wesselhoeft.</p></div>

<p>At about the same time stories of child
life for young children were restricted to
those which were most natural and possible,
and stories read by older girls in
which adults were made the beneficiaries
of a surprisingly wise child hero, such
as the Plympton books, were eliminated.</p>

<p>The successful elimination of these
books, together with the study of the
children's reading as a whole, suggested
within the next two or three years that
other books could be eliminated or restricted
without shock to the readers. On
the pedagogical basis, certain types of
books for young children were judged; on
the social basis, certain types of books
for older children, with results as follows:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>1. The elimination of word books for
little children, and the basing of their
reading upon their inherent love for
folk lore and verse.</p>

<p>2. The elimination of interpreted folk
lore, such as many of the modern
kindergarten versions.</p>

<p>3. The elimination of the modern fairy
tale, except as it has vitality and
individual charm, as have those of
George MacDonald.</p>

<p>4. The elimination of travel trivial in
treatment and in series form, such as
the Little Cousins.</p>

<p>5. The restriction of an old and recognized
series to its original number
of titles, such as the Pepper series.
The disapproval of all new books
obviously the first in a series.</p>

<p>6. Lessening the number of titles by
authors who are unduly popular, such
as restricting the use of Tomlinson
to one series only.</p>

<p>7. The elimination of those stories in
which the child character is not
within a normal sphere; for instance,
the child novel, such as Mrs. Jamison's
stories.</p>

<p>8. The restriction of the story of the
successful poor boy to those within
the range of possibility, as are the
Otis books, largely.</p></div>

<p>Without analyzing the weaknesses of all
these types, I wish to say a word about
the series form for story and classed
books. The series must be judged not
only by content, but it must be recognized
that by the admission of such a form of
literature the tendency of the child toward
independence of book judgment and
book selection is lessened and the way
paved for the weakest form of adult literature.</p>

<p>The last policies regarding book selection
developed on the same principles
within the past three years have been
these:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>1. The elimination of periodical literature
for young children, such as the
Children's Magazine and Little Folks,
since their reading can be varied
more wholesomely without it.</p>

<p>2. The elimination, or use in small numbers,
of a type of history and biography
which lacks scholarly, or even
serious treatment, such as the Pratt
histories.</p>

<p>3. Lessening the number of titles of
miscellaneous collections of folk lore
in which there are objectionable in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>dividual
tales; as, for instance, buying
only the Blue, Red, Green and
Yellow fairy books.</p>

<p>4. Recognizing "blind alleys" in children's
fiction, such as the boarding
school story and the covert love story,
and buying no new titles of those
types.</p></div>

<p>Reports of reading sequences from each
children's room have furnished the basis
for further study of children's reading for
the past seven months. These have been
discussed and compared by the workers,
and are now in shape for a working outline
of reading sequences to be made and
reported back to each room, to be used,
amplified and reported on again in the
spring.</p>

<p>While those books which are no longer
used may have been at one time necessary
to hold a child from reading something
poorer, we did not lose children through
raising the standard, and the duplication
of doubtful books in the children's room
is less heavy now than it was a few years
ago. Also there are more than twice as
many children who are reading, and almost
three times as many books being read
as there were nine years ago, while the
number of children of the city has increased
but 72 per cent. Furthermore, the
proportion of children of environmental
limitations has by no means diminished,
and the foreign population is much the
same&mdash;more than 75 per cent. Of course,
the elimination of some books was accomplished
because there were better books on
these subjects, but the general result was
largely brought about because in the establishment
of these higher standards <b>we
did not exceed the standards of those who
were working with the children.</b> The standards
which they brought to the work, and
which they deduced themselves from their
experience, were strengthened through
Round Table discussion, where each
worker measured her results by those of
the others and thereby recognized the need
of constant, but careful experimentation.
A children's department can not reach
standards of reading which in the judgment
of the librarians working with the
children are beyond the possibility of attainment,
for with them rests entirely the
delicate task of the adjustment of the book
to the child. A staff of children's librarians
of good academic education, the best library
training, a true vision of the social
principles, a broad knowledge of children's
literature, is the greatest asset for any
library maintaining children's work.</p>

<p>But it is true inversely that in raising
the standards of the children the standards
of the workers were raised. By this, I
mean that there were methods of book
presentation in use whereby the worker
saw farther and deeper into the mentality
of the child and understood his social instincts
better. This has been evidenced
in the larger duplication of the better
books. The methods are those which recognize
group interest and group association
as a social need of childhood. Through
unifying and intensifying the thoughts and
sympathies of the children by giving them,
when in association with their own playmates,
a common experience of living in
great and universal thought in the story
hour, the mediocre was bridged and both
the child and the worker reached a higher
plane of experience. By giving children a
chance for group expression of something
which has fundamental group interest, not
only the children recognized that books
may be cornerstones for social intercourse
and that there is connection between social
conduct as expressed in books and social
obligation, but, what is also vastly important,
the worker learned that when children
are at the age of group activity and
expression they can often be more permanently
influenced through their group
relations than as individuals.</p>

<p>Through the recognition of the principle
that there are standards of book use with
individual children and other standards
of book appeal for groups of children, it
was shown that the organization of the
work as a whole must be such that all
avenues of presentation of literature could
be fully developed. It was seen that far
less than with the individual child could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
we afford to give a group of children a
false experience or impotent interest, and
that material for group presentation,
methods of group presentation and the
social elements which are evinced in
groups of children should receive an
amount of attention and study which would
lead to the surest and soundest results.
This could be fully accomplished only by
recognizing such methods as distinct functions
of the department, to be maintained
on sound pedagogical and social bases.
In other words, that there should not only
be divisions of work with children according
to problems of book distribution, such
as by schools and home libraries, but
there must be of necessity divisions by
problems of reading. Whereas, in a smaller
department all divisions would center in
the head, the volume of work in the library
above alluded to rendered necessary the
appointment of an instructor in storytelling
and a supervisor of reading
clubs, which has resulted in a higher specialization
and a greater impetus for these
phases of work than one person could have
accomplished. Here we have an instance
of the benefit that a large volume of work
may confer upon the individual child.</p>

<p>With the attainment of better reading
results and higher standards for the workers,
it was obvious that the reading experiences
of the children and the standards
of the workers must be conserved, that
the organization should protect the children,
as far as possible, from the shock
of change of workers in individual centers.
Within the past two years considerable
study has been given to this, and yearly
written reports on the reading of children
in each children's room are made, in
which variations of the children's reading
in that library from accepted standards,
with individual instances, are usually
discussed. However, the children's librarian
is entirely free to report the subject
from whatever angle it has impressed
her most. Also a written report is made
of the story hour, the program, general
and special reading results, and intensity
of group interest in certain types of
stories. This report is supplementary to
a weekly report in a prescribed form of
the stories told, sources used and results.
All programs used with clubs are reported
and a semi-annual report made of the club
work as a whole. A yearly tabulation is
made of registration from public and parochial
schools, giving registration in all
libraries, class rooms and home libraries.
By discussion and reports back to individual
centers, these become bases for a
wider vision of work and a wiser direction
of energy with less experimentation.</p>

<p>The connection between work with children
and the problem of the reading of
intermediates, referred to in the beginning,
should not be dismissed in a paragraph.
However, it is only possible to give a short
statement of it. Recognizing that the reading
of adult books should begin in the children's
room, a serious study of adult books
possible for children's reading was made
by the children's librarians for two summers,
the reports discussed and books
added to the department as the result. A
second report of adult titles which children
and intermediates might and do read
was called for recently and from that a
tentative list has been furnished both adult
and children's workers for further study.
The increasing number of workers in the
children's department who have had general
training, and in the adult work who
have had special training for work with
children will make such reports of much
value. It may be interesting to know
that fifteen of the children's librarians
have had general training and six adult
workers in important positions have had
special training for children's work. Four
years ago there were only three in children's
work who had had general training
and none in adult work with the special
training. In order to follow the standards
of children's work, there is one principle
which is obvious, namely, a book disapproved
as below grade for juvenile should
not be accepted for general intermediate
work. This is especially true of books of
adventure which a boy of any age between
12 and 18 would read. It has been possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
to raise the standard of books for adults
in the school libraries above that of the
larger libraries. This will furnish eventually
another angle for the study of the
problem of intermediate reading.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the chief influences in the
establishment of right reading for children
are an intensive study of the reading of
children in relation to its social, moral and
pedagogical worth to them, the right basis
of education and training for such study
on the part of the workers, the direction
of such study in a way that brings about a
higher and more practical standard on the
part of the worker, and the conservation of
her experience. These are the great services
which the library should render children,
and they can be most fully accomplished
through departmental organization.</p>

<p>These papers were followed by a discussion,
led by Miss Stearns and Mr. Rush, in
which advice was given to those selecting
children's books to eliminate, in buying
new books, those which would be eliminated
later, and the suggestion was made
that children's librarians should enter the
field of writing children's books. Dr.
Bostwick of St. Louis then gave a report
on</p>


<h3>VOLUME OF CHILDREN'S WORK IN
THE UNITED STATES</h3>

<p>We may divide the history of work with
children into three epochs. During the
first, our libraries were realizing with increasing
clearness the necessity of doing
something for children that they were not
doing for adults. During the second this
conviction had taken the practical form of
segregation, physical and mental, and its
details were worked out with definiteness.
In the third, in which we still are, the
whole administrative work of the library
for children is being systematized and co-ordinated.
These three stages may be
roughly styled the era of work with children,
the era of the children's room and
the era of the children's department. The
first began, in any particular library, when
that library began to do anything whatever
for children that it was not doing for
adults; the second, when it opened its
first children's room; the third, when it
co-ordinated all its children's work under
one administrative head. In most libraries
the first period was relatively short; the
second relatively long. Some libraries
began their work by establishing children's
rooms, reducing the first period to zero.
Some large libraries are still in the second
period, never having co-ordinated their
children's work. Here are the approximate
dates for a few libraries:</p>

</table>

<p>I lay no stress on the accuracy of these
dates, particularly in the first column,
where in some cases they are matters of
opinion. Pittsburgh appears as a unique
example of a library that stepped full-fledged
into all three stages at once, starting
off, as soon as it began to do children's
work at all, not only with a children's
room, but with a definitely organized department
to conduct the work.</p>

<p>With the idea of presenting comprehensively
some idea of the volume and importance
of children's work in the United
States at the present time, a questionnaire
was sent out to libraries (78 in all) whose
total home use was 100,000 volumes or
more. Of these 51 responded. These have
been divided into five groups, five "very
large" libraries, circulating more than 2,000,000;
eight "large" ones, between one
and two million; seven "medium," between
half a million and a million; thirteen
"small," between quarter and half a million,
and eighteen "very small," from 100,000
to 250,000. The results for each of
these groups have been stated separately&mdash;averaged
where possible.</p>

<p>First, regarding the total volume of
work. The answers to the questions show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
that in 51 of the 78 largest public libraries
in the country, graded by circulation&mdash;libraries
containing altogether nearly
9,000,000 books and circulating a total
of over 30 millions&mdash;there are now 1,147,000
volumes intended especially for children.
Children drew out during the last
year 11,200,000 volumes for home use. Volumes
for children added during the year
numbered 280,000. These libraries have
231 rooms devoted entirely to children
and 180 used by them in part, with a combined
seating capacity of 15,900. Classroom
libraries are furnished for the children
in the schools, by 31 libraries reporting,
to the number of 5,000.</p>

<p>Children in 46 libraries reporting hold
altogether 413,000 library cards. There
are 42 supervisors of children's work, with
numerous clerical assistants and staffs of
473 persons, of whom at least 177 are qualified
children's librarians, 108 are graduates
of library schools, and 54 have had partial
courses.</p>

<p>The general conclusion deducible from
the statistics gathered seems to be that in
some ways library work with children has
become standardized while in others it
has not. Standards, whether permanent
or not, we can not tell, have been reached
or approximated in the number of books
devoted to children's use and, in general,
in the proportion of the library's resources,
time and energy that is given to this
branch of the work. But when we come
to the specific number of assistants assigned
to it, their supervision, their pay
and the grade of experience and training
required of them, then we all part company.
Not only is there no general agreement
here, but some of the discrepancies
are so large that we can ascribe them only
to the fact that we are still in the experimental
stage.</p>

<p>For instance, to take first the fairly uniform
or standardized conditions, the fraction
of the stock of books allotted to children
is about one-fifth in the larger libraries
and decreases slightly in the smaller;
in the very small it is about one-eighth.
The proportion of juvenile books added
yearly is much larger; it varies from nearly
one-half in the very large libraries down
to one-fourth in the very small. This
would seem to be a result of the increasing
stress laid on children's work. If this
proportion is maintained in the annual
purchases, that in the total stock may approximate
to it in time, although we can
not be sure of this without knowing the
ratio of the life of a children's book to
that of an adult book. The children's
books are doubtless shorter-lived, and this
would tend to keep the proportion down
in the permanent stock. The circulation is
still more nearly uniform, being about one-third
to children in all the classes of libraries.
The proportion of money spent for
children is also uniform, being about one-fourth
in libraries of all sizes. The same
is true of the number of children's rooms,
which throughout all classes of libraries,
both large and small, are in the proportion
of one to every 60,000 to 70,000 of circulation,
and of their seating capacity,
which is 60 to 70 per room.</p>

<p>Looking on the other side of the shield
we find the greatest variation in the proportion
of children's cards in use, which
runs from less than one-half up to nearly
all. From one to five supervisors are employed
in each library but some of the very
large libraries use only one and some of
the small ones as many as three. The
same is true of clerical assistants, of which
some of the very small libraries report as
many as three, while some of the very
large get along with as few as two.</p>

<p>Salaries are fairly uniform, although
apparently smaller than the work would
warrant. Whereas the children's circulation
is about one-third the total, the salaries
in the juvenile department are from
one-seventh to one-eighth the total
throughout. In the "small" libraries they
are only one-eleventh of the total.</p>

<p>The distribution of library-school graduates
is very irregular. Some libraries in
all classes have none at all. In the three
lower classes no library has a larger number
than three. In some of the larger libraries
there may be as many as 20 or 30.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>I am aware that some of this irregularity,
which I have called a lack of standardization,
may be due to differences in
nomenclature. Assistants, for instance,
having precisely the same duties may be
described as supervisors in one library and
not in another. This will not explain everything,
however, and the conclusion is
inevitable that in the respects just noted
no uniformity has yet been reached by libraries.
It seems to me that this lack
of standardization has made its appearance
in precisely the place where it might
have been expected&mdash;namely in the third
of the three periods already mentioned,
that of co-ordination and systematization.
This is the latest period; some libraries
have not yet entered upon it and most of
them are young in it. In other words,
children's work is much older than the
systematic administration of a children's
department, or a system of children's
rooms. Hence, children's work in general&mdash;the
selection and purchase of books for
children, the planning of children's rooms
and their administration as units&mdash;has existed
long enough to become standardized.
We know what we want, having passed
through the stage of experimentation.</p>

<p>This is not true of the administration of
a children's department&mdash;the grading of
assistants, the organization of a compact
body of workers with its expert supervision,
the settling of questions of disputed
jurisdiction that necessarily arise in cases
of this kind. It is on this part of their
work that children's librarians need to
focus their attention for the next few
years. It is time, not perhaps to withdraw
our eyes from the older questions but to
transfer our gaze in part to the newer.
We need to talk less about the size of our
juvenile collection, methods of selection of
children's books, the salaries of our assistants,
ways of increasing our circulation,
sizes and plans of children's rooms, and so
on, and more about the organization and
administration of the children's department
as a whole&mdash;the duties of the supervisor
and her assistants; her relations
with the heads of other departments and
with branch librarians, the measure of
control shared by her with heads of
branches in case of children's librarians of
branches, the existence of separate
grades, corresponding to separate duties
or variation of qualifications, among the
children's librarians; insistence on training
adapted to these different grades. Time
forbids me to go into details, and I can
but suggest these points for your consideration.
Into one point, however, I feel
like going a little more fully:</p>

<p>We need more special training for children's
work. It is the one kind of specialization
that we have attempted in our
schools, and we must have more of it and
more kinds of it. This of course is but a
single case in the more varied program
of special training that I am convinced
we shall have to take up before long. In
the course of an interesting debate on this
subject in the A. L. A. Council last January
it developed that most of the librarians
present looked upon specialization as impractical.
In particular they believed it
impossible for a student to look forward
so definitely to special work that he could
decide on the special courses that would
benefit him. The man that had taken the
college-library course might become a
superintendent of branches; the qualified
municipal reference librarian would go,
perhaps, into an applied science room.
This may be so now but it cannot long
remain the case. Even now we can not
carry this line of argument much further
without making of it a reductio ad absurdum.
Why go to a library school at all
when, after all, you may accept the headship
of a grammar-school on graduation,
or even decide to travel for a hardware
house? Why should we attempt to train
one man for a lawyer and another for a
physician when both may prefer farming?
We are getting away fast from the old
idea, born of pioneer conditions, that anybody
can do anything if he tries. We shall
have to travel further enough from it to
satisfy ourselves that an expert university
librarian will have to be trained for his
post and not for that of head of the supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
department in a public library. We have
learned that a children's librarian does her
work better for special training; may it
not be that we shall have to make some
difference in the future between training,
let us say, for supervisory work, for the
charge of a branch children's room, and
for the duties of an assistant of lower
grade?</p>

<p>In closing, let me say again that we need
to focus our attention at present on the
organization and administration of a children's
department, especially on the places
where it interlocks with that of other departments.
The study of this matter
should not be entrusted to children's libraries
alone, for the standardization of work
involving more than one department
should not be <b>ex parte</b>. The matter should
be in charge of a committee including in
its membership both chief librarians and
the heads of children's departments&mdash;possibly
also the children's librarian of a large
branch library and a branch librarian.</p>

<p>The volume of the work is now remarkable;
its organization has gone beyond
that of some other departments in attention
to detail; the question of its co-ordination
and of interdepartmental relations
should now be taken up systematically.</p>

paper entitled</p>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></div>


<h3>POSSIBILITIES OF THE RURAL
SCHOOL LIBRARY</h3>

<p>On the outermost fringe of library influence
they wait&mdash;the country children.</p>

<p>To fulfill to them the mission of the library,
to make books necessary and accessible,
we must take account of the
agency which touches the life of even
the most remote group&mdash;the country
school.</p>

<p>Relationships between libraries and
schools have long afforded discussion and
the librarian is rare who does not feel a
sense of her share in the educational work
of the town and her responsibility in making
her library serve as an adjunct to
the school, supplementing or supplanting
its library resources.</p>

<p>The country school and its library has
in the main been outside this friendly concern
or ministration on the part of the
town library and but little account taken
of it as a part of the library resources or
possibilities of a county or state.</p>

<p>The present revival of rural interest has
quickened every phase of country life, social,
economic and educational.</p>

<p>The country school has shared in the
enlargement of interest and is undergoing
many radical changes in its spirit, its
teaching, its relationships to the neighborhood
and the world outside.</p>

<p>While in former times the country child
went to school only when not needed at
home and received through the year an
intermittent schooling, amounting in all
to but few weeks a year, compulsory education
laws in the majority of states have
prolonged the period which he now actually
spends in school, and subsidies in
state aid for longer terms have lengthened
the season through which the school is
in operation.</p>

<p>The new emphasis on country life is
a transforming effect on the country
school, "the ragged beggar sunning" is
being replaced by a modern building
planned according to state regulations,
with regard to comfort and convenience,
seats and lighting are seriously considered
and the individual drinking cup adds
the last touch of modernity.</p>

<p>It is changing its teaching as carefully.
The leaders in country school work are
striving to give a standing to country service,
to reshape it to new country conditions
and connect its work very definitely
with the neighborhood in which it is
placed.</p>

<p>In Minnesota there are three types of
rural schools. The first of these is the
one-room, one-teacher school in an isolated
community where every grade is represented
and all subjects taught. The second
type is the associated school where
several districts have connected themselves
with a town school, where the pupils
of high school age are received on the
same term as their town cousins, and the
one-room schools continue the work with
the lower grades in the country but under
the supervision of the central school. The
third is the consolidated school where a
number of districts have combined and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
established in a town, village or open country
a modern school for the grades and
high school, transporting to it all the
children within the radius of five miles.</p>

<p>In all of these schools, the old course
of study is adapted to include health instruction,
nature study or agriculture, some
manual training, sewing and cooking. The
high school training departments and the
normal schools are making all haste to prepare
teachers to fulfill the new requirements
while the teachers already at work
must bring themselves up to grade at the
summer schools. The practical subjects
make a strong appeal. A country teacher
at the summer school was heard to remark
that "the rope-tying lessons were awfully
interesting and the course in agriculture
was just grand."</p>

<p>As a help in the new order of things a
strong school library is needed more than
ever. Even in the smallest school there is
indeed a collection of books known as the
school library, the heritage of the years.
These show no design in selection further
than meeting the state aid requirement of
the expenditure of a certain amount of
money every year for library books. The
trail of the book agent is over them all:
witness the sets; Motley&mdash;"History of the
United Netherlands," Grote&mdash;"History of
Greece," Gibbon&mdash;"Rome," and such subscription
books as "Lights and shadows of
a missionary's life" and "The Johnstown
flood."</p>

<p>The erstwhile teachers and their interests
have left an impress; the correspondence
courses which they pursued while
teaching are reflected in such books as
Hamerton&mdash;"Intellectual life"; "The literature
of the age of Elizabeth"; and all the
Epochs, and Eras and Periods in which
they delved for credits; their faith bears
witness in the "Life of Luther" found in
every school library in one western county
and their hopes in "How to be happy
tho' married," common in another.</p>

<p>The average number of volumes in each
school is impressive in reports, but inspection
of the libraries too often shows that
the majority of the books are entirely useless
in connection with the school work
and quite beyond the grasp and interest of
the pupils who may be typified by little
moon-faced Celestia who trudges two miles
through the pine forest to the little log
schoolhouse and to whom an illustrated
book is a revelation of worlds unknown;
Anna, eleven years old, who at the time of
our visit was doing the work of the household
and caring for her mother and the
new baby brother before she came to
school, for in this county the size of the
state of Connecticut there are but five doctors
and fewer nurses; Mary, aged 13, who
keeps house for an older brother and his
logging "crew" of four grown men; and little
Irven, 7 years old, who reads so fast
the words can hardly come and who is
willing and eager to aver in round childish
scribble that his favorite books are "Seven
little sisters," Eskimo stories and Fairy
stories and fables.</p>

<p>However hard to realize, the needs are
simple to state; better books and direction
in their use.</p>

<p>In many of the newer libraries there
are many good and suitable books and the
more progressive county superintendents
are paying more attention to their libraries,
making use of the suggestive lists
furnished them and selecting all the books
for the schools in their counties. One
proudly reports the purchase in his county
in the last year of 2144 <b>real</b> children's
books. The standardization of the state
school list has helped in later years, and
as they are obliged to buy from this list
there is a pleasing lack of "Motor boys"
and "Aeroplane girls."</p>

<p>Some few of the teachers have the notion
of the purpose of the school library
and are eager to extend its influence. One
teacher, combining school work with
homesteading, asked for help in getting illustrated
books and pictures, explaining
that he found it difficult to give images
to the words in their texts as the children
in his school had never seen a locomotive,
a train of cars, a bridge, a tower,
a brick or stone building, and the nearest
approach to the palace of which they read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
in their stories was the two-story square
frame building in the adjoining settlement.
The teacher of Anna and Mary realizing
that they would not be allowed to stay in
school longer than the law required, having
now had more schooling than their
father or mother, was trying to give them
some simple instruction in household
work and was glad to know of "When
Mother lets us cook" and the simple books
of sewing; and the town girl teaching her
first term in the country school tells of
her experience in using books of drawing
to tame the young "Jack-pine savage"
who had been the bully of the school.</p>

<p>The country teacher, as a type, is hardly
more than a child herself, born, or
transplanted at an early age, into pioneer
conditions of work and living with the
energies and thought of the family concentrated
on getting a start in life in the
new land.</p>

<p>In these homes books have not been
plentiful, in some the catalog of the mail
order house is often the only printed matter
in evidence, having apparently displaced
the family Bible from its time-honored
place on the center table.</p>

<p>In the early schooling and life of the
country teacher only the textbooks have
left an impress and when she is asked at
a country teachers' meeting or in the beginning
of her normal school course to
name favorite children's books, she puts
down the texts she studied in the country
schools, the Baldwins, the Carpenters, the
Wheelers and the rest.</p>

<p>The stage of poverty and extreme hardship
is fast passing. With increased prosperity
comes the opportunity for better
things, usually desired by the children, not
always by the parents.</p>

<p>The school inspector was urging a new
schoolhouse. The farmer thought this one
good enough. After dinner they went out
to see the fine stock and seeing the splendid
barns for the stock the inspector said:
"You provide such good buildings for your
stock you ought to be willing to do something
for your children." The farmer still
demurred and the inspector pressed the
matter. "Do you care more for your stock
than for your children?" The farmer became
indignant and said: "I want you to
know that stock is thoroughbred." If the
parents have lost or never had the power
to enjoy books, the school and the library
must see to it that this asset is given the
child in the country, who tomorrow must
deal with the problems of the new country
life more complex than his fathers have
known; the farmer's wife to become emancipated
must learn to use the books which
will help her, and there must be foundations
for the larger citizenship for in spite
of all efforts to keep the boy on the farm
he will continue to join the ranks of the
financiers, the doctors, the judges, the governors
and the like.</p>

<p>The newer idea of the use of books and
reading in the country schools is taking
hold if sometimes vaguely. "I tell them to
read library books," she said when asked
what use she made of the school library.
"Oh no, I have never read any of them myself,"
and "Little women" and "Captains
courageous" and many other live children's
books stood in perfect condition on the
shelf, though there were a number of children
in the school old enough to enjoy
them, and only such books had been used
as the more adventurous spirits in the
school had tasted, found good and passed
on to their fellows.</p>

<p>Few children have books of their own&mdash;one-third&mdash;one-fourth&mdash;one
in ten being the
answer which comes from the teachers to
this query. Generally speaking, they read
the books in the school library or none at
all unless there is a traveling library at
hand.</p>

<p>Teachers' training departments in the
high schools are doing much to help the
country school. In the year's work the
students get much of the spirit as well as
methods of country school teaching for the
training teacher is usually eager to give
them all she has of enthusiasm and efficiency
and reaches out for all help in her
work.</p>

<p>In one teacher's outlines, familiar looking
notes on book selection and lists of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
children's books were discovered. She had
patiently copied them from the summer
school notes of the librarian in her home
town and was using them with her students.
In addition to her regular work she
looks after the school library which is
open to the public and also gives help to
schools in the country in the arrangement
of their school libraries. In most of these
departments some work is attempted on
the rural school library with required reading
of children's books.</p>

<p>The town librarians find these classes
an opportunity to extend their influence
by talks in the schools and showing the
resources and use of the library. Acquaintance
and work with country teachers
helped one librarian to put through a long-cherished,
long-fought scheme of county
extension. As the teachers understand
more fully the help they can get from the
library the more eagerly they consult the
librarian about their work.</p>

<p>The inclusion of talks on children's
books, reading and school libraries on the
programs of the county teachers' and
school officers' meetings, talks and exhibits
at district and state educational gatherings
and the University weeks have helped
to give school libraries new importance in
the estimation of the teachers.</p>

<p>The country school library to become
useful must be reduced to a collection of
books suited to the ages of the pupils as
well as to the work in the school. As
elsewhere, the best way to get the country
child to read the best books is to have no
other kind.</p>

<p>Recent library legislation makes it possible
for any country or town school library
in Minnesota to combine with a public
library for service. They may turn
over their books not needed in the school
and what is more valuable to the library,
the fund which they are annually required
to spend for library books. In return the
library must furnish the school with traveling
libraries of books selected from the
state school list, suited to the pupils in the
school, and the school may also be a distributing
point for books for the neighborhood,
a real branch.</p>

<p>In some of the associated school districts
the central library sends to the associated
schools traveling libraries purchased by
the district or borrowed from the library
commission. In others, the country pupils
act as a circulating medium for the central
school library. In one town the school
and town jointly maintain a good library
with a competent librarian in the schoolhouse
and it successfully serves the town,
the pupils for their reference work and the
country 'round about through the country
boys and girls who come in every day to
school.</p>

<p>The village or open country consolidated
school presents yet another opportunity.
These schools are the direct outgrowth of
the new spirit of country life and are
planned to minister to the social as well as
the educational needs of the combined districts;
and serve as a social center. The
library is an important part of the equipment
for this work.</p>

<p>State plans for these buildings include
a good-sized assembly room, and a room
for a library is required. The principal
of the school must be shown how the library
may help him in his work and he
must be assisted in the selection of books
not only for the school work but also for
the boys' and girls' club, the potato and
corn growing contests, the farmers' club, the
women's club, the debating societies, literary
evenings, and social gatherings
which he plans to make features of his
school.</p>

<p>Such are some of the possibilities. To
make them realities, the teachers must be
trained in an understanding of the purpose
of a library and a knowledge of children's
books, and every library agency in
every county and state must be quickened
toward the most remote of "all of the children
of all of the people."</p>

<p>In the discussion by Mr. Kerr, Miss Burnite,
Miss Brown, Miss Allin, Miss Zachert
and Miss Hobart, which followed, the following
points were made: That the time
to accomplish the work in question is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
when the teachers are in the normal
schools, that such work should be based
upon the teachers' intensive knowledge of
children's books, and that influence may
be gained by approaching the superintendents
and by using as advertising mediums
the school papers to which the teachers
subscribe.</p>

<p>Miss Power then gave the chair to Miss
Mary E. Hall, librarian Girls' high school,
Brooklyn, N. Y. Miss Hall introduced Miss
MAUDE McCLELLAND, who told of her
work in charge of the library in a high
school in Passaic, N. J., pronounced by
Miss Hall to be a model of its kind. Miss
McClelland made a very happy comparison
of the old time school boy and the school
boy of today and discussed modern high
school methods of helping children to meet
actual problems in life.</p>

<p>Miss McClelland said in part:</p>


<h3>THE WORK OF A HIGH SCHOOL
BRANCH</h3>

<p>In the preface to a volume of essays entitled
"Literature and life," William Dean
Howells defends the doctrine that the tree
of knowledge, so familiar to all of us, is in
reality but a branch of the tree of life. Literature,
instead of having a separate existence
of its own, is, as a matter of fact,
but a part of life, and all that is necessary
to make it a vital force in the lives of human
beings is to establish its identity with
life.</p>

<p>Now the emphasizing of this unity of literature
and life has become the self-appointed
task of the modern public library&mdash;a
task which it is approaching from a
number of different angles, such as work
with children, work with clubs, work with
foreigners, and work with schools. Something
of what the library is doing along
one of these lines&mdash;that of work with
schools&mdash;may be learned by studying the
methods in use in the high school branch
of a public library.</p>

<p>Perhaps these methods may best be illustrated
by contrasting the school days
of two brothers, Adam and Theodore. Now
Adam went to school in the good old days
when there were no high school libraries,
and indeed very few libraries of any kind.
At 9 o'clock every morning the active interests
of life ceased for him. He then
entered the schoolhouse and began the
study of a set of lessons, which far removed
from real life in themselves, could
not be made intensely vital even by the
best of teachers, because there was no library
in the building upon which the
teachers could draw for books and other
materials to illustrate the connection between
the classics and real life.</p>

<p>The first subject upon his program was
ancient history. This he learned with the
aid of a textbook, condensed in form, and
attenuated in spirit. To him the book was
a collection of disagreeable facts to be
learned by heart and then forgotten as
quickly as possible after examinations
were over.</p>

<p>Now, when Adam's brother Theodore entered
the school, matters had changed. A
branch of the public library had been installed,
and the history teacher was no
longer handicapped in her work. The members
of Theodore's class had all been given
special topics for investigation, so when
the class in ancient history was called, one
pupil drew upon the board the plan of a
Greek house, which he had copied from
Harper's classical dictionary, while another
pupil, who had been to the library
and interviewed Gulick's "Life of the ancient
Greeks," described the furniture and
cooking utensils of the Greeks, and told
about the kind of things they had to eat.
And Theodore began to realize that after
all, those ancient Greeks were real people,
just like other real people. So from that
history lesson he carried away inspiration
from the life of the past toward the living
of his own life of the present and future.</p>

<p>The next lesson on the schedule for the
day was English. Now, when Adam went
to school, he had been rather fond of reading&mdash;but
that there could be any connection
between reading and the English work
given him at school never entered his head
for a moment. True, they did some reading
in the English class, but it was read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>ing
in which he wasn't very much interested,
though he supposed that in some
vague way it probably did him a great deal
of good. The real reading, which he did
surreptitiously at home was of an entirely
different kind. Far from imagining that
he derived any benefit from it, he at times
even feared that he was endangering his
immortal soul. But he felt that the pleasure
was worth it. The two kinds of reading,
if tabulated, would be about as follows,
the comparative amount done being
in about the ratio of 16 to 1 in favor
of the kind he liked&mdash;if he had luck in borrowing
books from the boys:</p>

<p class="center">School Reading
</p>


<ul><li>Rhetoric and composition.</li>
<li>Evangeline.</li>
<li>Pilgrim's progress.</li>
<li>Selections from Milton.</li>
<li>Lady of the lake.</li>
</ul>

<p class="center">Home Reading
</p>


<ul><li>The downward path or A debt of vengeance.</li>
<li>Helping himself.</li>
<li>A leap in the dark.</li>
<li>Trapped in his own net.</li>
</ul>

<p>The school reading was unexceptionable
as to literary character, but, at least for
the growing boy of average intelligence,
it seemed to lack attractiveness.</p>

<p>When Theodore entered the English
class in high school, times had changed.
The first thing the teacher did was to give
him a list of books for home reading. At
the top of the list was written, "These
books may be borrowed either from the
high school branch or from any other
branch of the public library." On the list
were such books as "Huckleberry Finn,"
"Tom Sawyer," "The jungle books," "Story
of a bad boy," "The wonder book and tanglewood
tales," "Treasure island" and "The
man without a country."</p>

<p>Now, these books have literary character;
they are attractive; furthermore, they
were written by authors who at all times
observe with proper respect and deference
the laws of the English language.</p>

<p>So, once more, through the aid of the library,
we find the connection between literature
and the joy of life established.</p>

<p>In the old days, not much had been said
about vocations, or working for a living.
Indeed, the only ambition considered really
worth while was that of going to college
and becoming educated. To leave school
before graduation was rather a disgrace,
and if any boy was, like Lady Macbeth's
guests, by force of circumstances, compelled
to "go, and stay not upon the order
of his going," his method of departure can
best be described by the expression, "slinking
out." But now, Theodore found the
school ready and willing to help all those
who had to leave school to go to work;
and again, the connection between real life
and school was established.</p>

<p>And if Theodore found that the library
was not lacking in books that would help
in the practical issues of life, neither did
he find a dearth of the books that are
needed for companionship&mdash;the books that
we are inclined to group under the heading
"Cultural reading." Oliver Wendell
Holmes, in one of his essays, says, speaking
of libraries, that he has the same easy
feeling when among books that a stableboy
has among horses. And it is perhaps
along this line&mdash;that of inculcating a real
love for books&mdash;that the greatest work of
the high school library lies.</p>

<p>In an article on "Children's reading" in
Harper's Weekly for May 31 there are
some valuable suggestions for the librarian,
not least among them that contained
in the last paragraph, which I shall quote:</p>

<p>"An excellent suggestion is that in all
public schools there should be, as well as
the supervisor of drawing, and the supervisor
of music, and the supervisor of manual
training, a supervisor of the art of
reading. For is not reading, after all, an
art, and an uplifting, consoling and educative
art?"</p>

<p>Mr. SAMUEL H. RANCK, librarian of
the Grand Rapids public library, read a full
and interesting paper on</p>


<h3>THE LIBRARY'S OPPORTUNITIES IN
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE</h3>

<p>In October, 1911, the Grand Rapids public
library published in its monthly bulletin
an outline of the Central high school
course in vocational guidance, with a se<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>lected
list of the library's books on this
subject for teachers and pupils. Five thousand
copies were printed, and no number
of the bulletin we have ever published has
received so much attention. Requests for
it have come from all over the world, and
a number of institutions have purchased
as many as 50 copies. This bulletin is now
out of print. In the near future, on the basis
of our experience of the last few years,
we expect to publish a revised edition of
the vocational guidance list, which will include
much new material purchased on
this subject in the last two years.</p>

<p>Although this list has received so much
attention outside of the city its greatest
success has been in the city itself. It has
brought to the library a great number of
young people for the books for circulation
and to the reference department for the
preparation of all sorts of themes on vocational
subjects as a part of their high
school work in English. It is not an uncommon
thing to find from 20 to 50 high
school students at one time working on
this subject in our reference department.
Incidentally this work at the library has
been a splendid training for the boys and
girls in the use of the reference books,
and regardless of any direct effect it might
have on their choice of a career it is certain
that the consideration of a number of
subjects in connection with the possibility
of their being followed as a vocation tends
to broaden the life of any young person.</p>

<p>At first this work was regarded somewhat
as a joke by some of the pupils but
there has been less and less of this as time
goes on. No work that the library has
ever done in the way of making certain
classes of books known to its readers has
met with anything like the response as has
this work of co-operation with the Central
high school.</p>

<p>All through this work the thought of
the library has been that it is a co-operating
agent rather than an institution
working independently, and it seems to me
that in all work of this kind the teacher
and the school through their intimate personal
knowledge of the child are in a much
better position to guide the boys and girls
than is the library. The library's place is
simply that of being fully alive and sympathetic
with the whole situation, and in
putting forth every effort to gather all
available data and to supply the needs of
those who can use printed material on this
subject. It does not of course neglect opportunities
for personal influence, but it
seems to me that the library can not take
the initiative in the same way nor on the
same scale as does the school. Through
the reading rooms the library has special
opportunities to direct the "misfit" who
comes to the library for a clue to a better
occupation.</p>

<p>Along with the list in our bulletin of
October, 1911, which by the way includes
only things in the circulating department
of the library, we published an outline of
work in vocational guidance in the Central
high school by Principal Davis. The following
is his statement and the outline, as
then in use, since modified somewhat on
the basis of practical experience.</p>


<h4>Outline of Work in Vocational Guidance
in the Central High School</h4>

<p class="center">By Jesse B. Davis, Principal</p>

<p>"Vocational guidance aims to direct the
thought and growth of the pupil throughout
the high school course along the line
of preparation for life's work. The plan is
intended to give the pupil an opportunity
to study the elements of character that
give success in life, and by a careful self
analysis to compare his own abilities and
opportunities with successful men and
women of the past. By broadening his
vision of the world's work, and applying
his own aptitudes and tastes to the field
of endeavor that he may best be able to
serve, it is attempted to stir the student's
ambition and to give a purpose to all his
future efforts. Having chosen even a tentative
goal his progress has direction. In
the later study of moral and social ethics
he has a viewpoint that makes the result
both practical and effective.</p>

<p>"In order to reach all the pupils in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
high school this work is carried on through
the department of English, which subject
all pupils must take. Brief themes and
discussions form the basis of the work.
Pupils are directed in their reading along
vocational and ethical lines and are advised
by teachers who have made a special
study of vocational guidance. The following
outline is but suggestive of the types
of themes and discussions to be used. Each
teacher is given opportunity to use her
own individuality in working out the details
of the scheme.</p>

<p>5. The responsibility of power."</p></div></div>

<p>The books in the bulletin were arranged
in accordance with the foregoing outline,
which takes the pupil through the whole
four years of high school work. Principal
Davis' statement of the aims and methods
of vocational guidance as it is being
carried on in Grand Rapids is sufficiently
clear I think, and does not require any additional
explanation. It should be clearly
understood, however, that vocational guidance
is altogether different from vocational
education and from industrial education,
subjects with which it is sometimes confused.</p>

<p>To meet the many demands which come
to Mr. Davis for information regarding vocational
guidance he is now at work on a
book which will discuss the whole matter
fully. This book will probably be ready
in the fall. It will contain a revised list
of our books on this subject.</p>

<p>At a recent meeting of the Board of
Education this work was organized and
systematized for the whole city, for all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
pupils in the seventh grade and upwards,
with Principal Davis as director of the
work.</p>

<p>In the light of our experience we believe
that the library, in addition to printing a
list of books such as given in accordance
with this outline, needs a supplementary
list arranged according to vocations. On
account of the growing interest in vocational
education and industrial education
there have been many useful books published
within the last few years. When
this work was first begun there was a
dearth of suitable material on a good many
subjects, and it was necessary for the library
to depend largely on magazine articles,
pamphlets, etc., in the reference department,
the best of which we have indexed
according to subject, along with our
indexing of other material such as college
catalogs, to show the institutions where
courses are given on particular subjects,
etc.</p>

<p>The following are a few of the subjects
called for recently, as they were noted in
the reference department: Nursing, Teaching,
Drafting, Social settlement work,
Dressmaking, Library work, Dentistry, Music,
Mining engineering, Electrical engineering,
Farming, Physical training, Agriculture,
Education of defectives, Forestry,
Playground work, Stenography, Art, Mechanics,
Magazine illustrating, Domestic
science, Landscape gardening, Designing
dresses, Housekeeping, Social secretary
work, Private secretary work, Decorative
painting, Baseball managership, Surveying,
Civil service, Kindergarten work, Scientific
farming, Physical culture.</p>

<p>The purpose in all this work is to endeavor
to aid boys and girls to find a work
in life that will command their best energies,
their intelligent interest, and is
adapted to their capacities, thus avoiding
so far as possible the bane of young people
drifting into the first thing that comes
along, whether they are fitted for it or not.
This work puts before them the widest
possible range of choice of vocation, enlarges
their horizon, and then endeavors
to ground them in those fundamental
moral qualities which are the basis of
every successful life.</p>

<p>By putting the right sort of books into
their hands in this way the library has a
tremendous opportunity for influencing
their lives at the most formative period,
and at the same time developing in them a
more or less serious attitude toward life
and its work. The study of the lives of
successful men and women and the study
of the work and requirements of different
vocations can not help but impress upon
boys and girls the importance of preparation
and conscientious effort as prime requisites
for success in any line of work.</p>

<p>We of the library in Grand Rapids are
of the opinion that the library alone in
such work could do very little. As already
stated we believe that the initiative should
come from the school. On the other hand,
we are firmly convinced that the school
alone without the co-operation of the library
would be very seriously handicapped.
In the first place the school would
be required to duplicate unnecessarily a
large number of the books which are in
our public libraries, and this of course
would be an economic waste. In the second
place the school would be denying the
children one of the best opportunities to
come in contact with an institution which
aids them in the continuation of their education
all through life after they leave
school. It is of immense value to the
child to get training in the use of the library
in connection with the thinking he
is giving to his work in after life. A better
introduction of the child to the value
of books and a public library, the library itself
could hardly ask.</p>

<p>But the library's greatest opportunity in
vocational guidance is in the fact that all
this work is really constructive manhood
and womanhood, or if you please, constructive
citizenship. And this is not only the
greatest work the library can do, but the
greatest work any institution can do.</p>

<p>This subject proved a timely one and
aroused considerable discussion. Many
questions were asked concerning the co-operation
of the public library in Grand Rap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>ids
with this department of work in the
high school. Mr. Ranck announced that
Mr. Davis, principal of the Central high
school, expects to bring out a book in the
fall which shall include outlines and the
list of books which has been in such great
demand and which is now out of print.</p>

<p>The discussion seemed to show that "vocational
guidance" is a legitimate field not
adequately covered by libraries. Miss
Power now took the chair.</p>

<p>Miss Burnite made a motion to adopt
the following resolution:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas, the members of the American
Library Association who are engaged in
work with children feel the great bond of
affection for all those who have rendered
that service to child life which the achievement
of efficient library service for children
signifies;</p>

<p>And whereas, the Dayton public library
has suffered the destruction of its children's
department and thereby the children
of the city are without the influence
of good books at the time they need them
most;</p>

<p>Be it resolved: that we express to the
Board of Trustees, the librarian, Miss Clatworthy,
the head of the children's department,
Miss Ely, our deep sympathy and the
hope that their work may be rehabilitated
upon a greater plane of service.</p>

<p>Be it resolved also, that these resolutions
be spread upon the minutes of this
meeting and the secretary be empowered
to forward them to the library officials
mentioned with the request that the resolutions
be forwarded to the Women's
Clubs of the city and especially to the
Mothers' Clubs as an expression of sympathy
for them also, in the loss of the department
of the library which has furthered
their own efforts in bettering child
life.</p></div>

<p>The motion was carried and the session
adjourned.</p>


<h3>BUSINESS MEETINGS</h3>

<p>At the business meetings of the section
held June 25th at 2:30 p. m. and after
the session, Friday, June 27th, the chairman
appointed three new members of the
advisory board, as follows: For one year,
Mr. Henry E. Legler, and, for three years,
Miss Linda Eastman and Miss Lutie E.
Stearns. Miss Annie C. Moore, Miss Clara
W. Hunt and Miss Caroline Burnite were
appointed members of the nominating committee
and upon their recommendation the
following officers for the ensuing year were
unanimously elected: Miss Agnes Cowing,
chairman; Miss Mary Ely, vice chairman;
Miss Ethel Underhill, secretary. Miss
Adah Whitcomb and Miss Faith Smith
were appointed by the chair to investigate
the subject of simplified headings in several
different libraries, to confer with the
Catalog Section and A. L. A. Publishing
Board, and to report to the Section.</p>

<h2>COLLEGE AND REFERENCE SECTION</h2>


<h3>MAIN SESSION</h3>

<p>The main session of the College and
Reference Section was held on Tuesday
afternoon, June 24th, at the Hotel Kaaterskill.
Mr. Andrew Keogh, reference librarian
of Yale University, presided; Miss
Amy L. Reed, librarian of Vassar College,
acted as secretary.</p>

<p>The chairman asked for a motion to fill
the vacancy on the committee of arrangements
which would be caused by his own
retirement. It was voted that the Chair
appoint a nominating committee; Mr. L. L.
Dickerson, librarian of Grinnell College,
and Miss Laura Gibbs, cataloger of Brown
University, were asked to serve as such a
committee.</p>

<p>The session then proceeded to the program
for the day, which was the work of
Miss Sarah B. Askew, New Jersey public
library commission, and of Mr. N. L. Goodrich,
librarian of Dartmouth College. In
order to secure pointed discussion Mr.
Goodrich had caused brief summaries of
the papers to be printed and distributed to
members of the section two weeks before
the meeting.</p>

<h3>INSTRUCTION IN THE USE OF A COLLEGE
LIBRARY</h3>

<p>Students who enter college are in an altogether
hopeless state, if we are to believe
the lamentations poured out in educational
reviews and in library journals.
In familiar phrase, "they have left undone
those things which they ought to have
done, and they have done those things
which they ought not to have done, and
there is no health in them." But it is not
given either a college librarian or a college
instructor to remain long hopeless,
either for himself or for others,&mdash;the very
nature of his calling demands that somebody
do something. Discouragement over
ignorant and untrained freshmen dissolves
into the bewildering questions of who is to
do what, and when, and where, and how.
And so the college year begins.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that a very large
majority of college freshmen are not familiar
with a large library such as they
meet in college, that they have never used
a card catalog, and that they would not
even recognize it if they saw one.</p>

<p>But is it reasonable to expect such
knowledge? The majority come from
small places where such opportunities are
not found, the work of the secondary
schools does not demand extensive use
of a library, and the mental immaturity
of pupils of the secondary school age does
not augur well either for an understanding
of the intricacies of the card catalog,
or for any special interest in the cataloging
of books, or in general library history
and administration. If the entering student
had a knowledge of these things, one
reason for going to college would be lacking,&mdash;he
goes to college to learn what he
cannot reasonably be expected to know
before that time.</p>

<p>Cheerfully accepting then this condition
of ignorance of all library procedure on
the part of the rank and file of college
freshmen everywhere, and unanimously
agreeing that the college student must in
some way learn how to use a library, diversity
of opinion is found in regard to
these two questions:&mdash;Is this instruction
given better as an independent course to
the entering students, or is it better to
give it in connection with regular college
work? Should the instruction be given
by members of the library staff, or by
college instructors?</p>

<p>The very fact that this question has
been broached is helpful, since it is significant
of the great changes that are
coming both in library administration and
in educational theory and practice. It suggests
the increasing specialization in library
work, the growing co-operation between
the library force and those engaged
in the more technical side of education,
newer and, we believe, higher ideals of the
object and therefore of the process of
education, and the reflection of these
changes in the development in the student
body of independence, self-reliance, and
the desire to do creative work.</p>

<p>Assuming therefore that we are all interested
in securing for the college student
fullness of knowledge at the earliest
hour possible, I venture personally to differ
somewhat from the report of the majority
of the committee of the New England
college librarians and to say that
from the angle of the college instructor,
it seems clear to me that the knowledge
is better acquired in connection with regular
college courses and that it can best
be given by college instructors. It is with
most of us a favorite occupation to see
how many birds we can bring down with
one stone, and this desire is in a sense
gratified if we can incorporate knowledge
of how to use a library with the subject
matter included in a particular course,&mdash;it
seems a saving of time for student, instructor
and librarian. Everything is clear
gain that can be picked up by the way.</p>

<p>But quite apart from this general desire
to telescope several subjects, there are
specific advantages gained by the student
when the instruction is given by the instructor
of a regular college class. The
knowledge acquired falls naturally into
its place in connection with definite, concrete
work. Abstract theory has little
place in the mental equipment of the fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
man, he seeks out relationships, adds new
knowledge to what he already has, and
quite reasonably is impatient, even intolerant
in spirit when new ideas and facts are
presented to him that he cannot immediately
assimilate. To use a homely illustration,
an article of food, like butter,
that is essential for our physical diet
serves its purpose much better when distributed
through other articles of food
than if taken independently and by itself.
All new ideas in regard to library organization,
cataloging, bibliography, searching
for material, the handling of books, if
gained through the usual channels of college
work, are quickly and easily assimilated
by the college student. If, however,
these same ideas are presented to him
unrelated to other work they are in danger
of remaining unassimilated and of becoming
a hindrance rather than a help.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the advantages in
having the instruction given by a regular
college instructor are that he deals with
small sections of students, not with "numbers
which are appallingly large;" that
he knows the individual student; that he
is able to relate the bibliographical work
with the individual student on the one
hand, and on the other hand with the special
subject with which the student is
working.</p>

<p>Personally, I can but feel that the assumption
made by the committee of the
New England college librarians, by the librarian
of the Newark public library, by
the dean of the collegiate department of
the University of Illinois, and by others in
the library field that college instructors
are not interested in this matter and would
oppose instruction in it is not really warranted
by the condition that exists.</p>

<p>May I venture to describe somewhat in
detail what is done in one college in showing
students how to use books, how to become
acquainted with the opportunities of
a large library, and how to avail themselves
of these opportunities in a direct
personal way. In giving this account of
what is done in Vassar College, may I emphasize
the statement that the work done
is by no means peculiar to one college,&mdash;other
institutions all over the country are
doing much that in principle is precisely
the same, although the details may vary.</p>

<p>The first aid in knowledge of the library
building, of its equipment, and of how to
use its collections is given the Vassar College
student literally during her first hours
on the college campus. She is met by a
member of the senior or the junior class
and taken about the campus, and it is the
duty of these student guides to give every
entering student a copy of the <b>Students'
Handbook</b>. In this she is urged to "become
acquainted with the library as soon
as possible." "The reference librarian,"
the <b>Handbook</b> tells her, "expects every
new student to come to the reference desk
to be shown about the arrangement of the
library and the use of the catalog and to
receive a copy of the library Handbook."</p>

<p>The guides point out the library and
they are instructed to urge the new students
to seek out the reference librarian
at once and to make the library trip immediately.
The new student goes to the
residence hall where she is to live and she
finds on the bulletin board in this hall an
invitation to take the library trip. The
records kept by the reference librarian
show that a very large percentage of the
entering students almost immediately
avail themselves of this invitation extended
by guides and reiterated by <b>Handbook</b>
and by bulletin boards.</p>

<p>When the new student first enters the
library she is given a plan of the building
showing the arrangement of the different
sections and a handbook explaining in
full the library privileges. Armed with
this, she is met by the reference librarian
and then joining a group of three others
she is taken through the library where she
makes connections between the plan in
her hand, the books on the shelves, "the
inanimate reference librarian&mdash;the card
catalog&mdash;" and the animate reference librarian
in whom she finds a guide, counselor
and friend.</p>

<p>This library trip can be, and is intended
to be only general in character. The stu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>dent
gains from it first of all the consciousness
of having found in the reference librarian
a friend to whom she can always go
for help and advice; second, her interest
is aroused to become better acquainted
with the card catalog and with the general
facilities for work afforded by the library;
and third she gains a determination to follow
the injunction of the <b>Students' Handbook</b>,
"do your part to make the library
an ideal place in which to work."</p>

<p>It is at this stage, after this general instruction
given by the reference librarian,
that the majority of the entering students
meet the officers of the department of
history. We give them collectively during
the first week, usually the second day, an
illustrated lecture on the library. This
includes slides showing the catalog cards
of a few of the books they will use most
in their history work, the cards of the
most important reference works, periodicals,
and atlases, slides showing the difference
between a "see" card and a "see
also" card, slides that explain incomplete
series, continuation cards, and every variation
that concerns their immediate work.
Every slide concerns a work on history
that is to be used almost immediately, and
the form used in cataloging, the notation
and the annotation, the hieroglyphics of
the printed card, and the bibliographical
features of the card are fully explained
from the screen.</p>

<p>The students then meet their individual
instructors, each one having previously
provided herself with a pamphlet called
<b>"Suggestions for the Year's Study, History
I."</b> This pamphlet, besides giving detailed
instructions for the preparation of
the work, includes a plan of the library;
suggestions in regard to its history, as also
the description and the meaning of its
exterior and interior; a facsimile and explanation
of the catalog card of the text
book used in the course; hints concerning
the general card catalog; an analysis
of the general form and different parts of
a book; special directions for preparing
the bibliographical slips or cards that
must accompany every topic presented, together
with an illustration of a model
card; a full classification, with illustrations
under each, of all the works of references
the class will presumably use, including
general works of reference, dictionaries,
encyclopaedias, periodicals, year
books, atlases, autobiographical material,
including the various forms of <b>Who's
Who?</b> together with biographical, ecclesiastical
and various miscellaneous dictionaries
and encyclopaedias; an elaborate
chart devised to show the authoritativeness
as history of the text book used in
the course, accompanied by a full explanation
of it; suggestions in regard to
the purchase of histories for a personal
library; and finally, a recommendation to
make use of another pamphlet called <b>Suggestive
Lists for Reading in History</b>. The
main points in the pamphlet <b>Suggestions
for the Year's Study</b> are talked over between
instructor and students, and constant
reference is made to it throughout
the year.</p>

<p>The next step in the history work is to
assign each student one or more questions
written on a slip and drawn by lot. These
questions are intended to test her assimilation
of the bibliographical help already
given, and her ability to apply to a concrete
case what she has gained. As soon
and as often as possible the students in
the different sections of this class in history
go to the library with the instructor
for such additional and special help as
they may need.</p>

<p>From time to time the students in History
I prepare special topics on limited
questions. A bibliography must always
preface these topics and if it is in any way
at fault, either as regards form or material,
it must be presented a second time
or as many times as is necessary to correct
the defects.</p>

<p>This course in History I is required of
every student in college. Those students
who elect other courses based on this become
acquainted with still other features
of the library and acquire added facility
in bibliographical work. Every student,
for example, who elects the course in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
American history has a pamphlet called
<b>Suggestions for the Year's Study, History
A, AA</b>. This pamphlet includes a
chart that shows the location in the library
of all the sections of American history,
each accompanied by the Dewey
notation for each section, and also the
notation for the sections in political science,
law and government, American literature,
English literature, and English
history. It also considers at length the
place in the course of the textbook, secondary
works, collections of sources, almanacs,
works on government, guides to
literature, state histories, biographies,
travels, and illustrative material. For the
latter the students are again referred to
<b>Suggestive Lists for Reading in History</b>.</p>

<p>Another section of the pamphlet considers
specific classes of books which the
student uses. It calls attention to the various
kinds of bibliographies, as complete,
selected, classified, and annotated; to library
catalogs arranged on the dictionary,
author, subject, and title plan, as also to
trade catalogs; to documents classified by
form and by contents; to official publications,
and the publications of historical
societies; to every form of personal record;
to descriptions by travelers; and to
general and special histories. It also takes
up periodicals; manuscripts; special facsimiles,
like the B. F. Stevens; geographical
material; monumental records; inscriptions,
and pictorial material.</p>

<p>Elaborate directions are given for preparing
exhaustive bibliographies of the
material in the college library on special
subjects and suggestions for expanding
these in the future as other opportunities
for further library work are presented. In
addition, tin trays of cards are provided
in the American history sections. These
are bibliographical cards that supplement
but do not duplicate the catalog cards of
the general library catalog.</p>

<p>During the year about twenty special
topics are prepared by this class, each prefaced
by a bibliography of the subject. At
the end of the year, one special bibliographical
topic is presented. This represents
what each student can do in the time
given to three classroom hours.</p>

<p>At the end of the first semester of this
course the examination given is not a test
of what the students have remembered but
rather a test of what they are able to do
under definite conditions. The class is sent
to the library, each member of it usually
receives by lot an individual question, and
she then shows what facility she has
gained in the use of books by answering
the question with full range of the library.</p>

<p>Other pamphlets of <b>Suggestions</b> have occasionally
been prepared for the most advanced
courses. At the end of the senior
year the students in my own courses are
frequently given an examination that calls
for the freest use of the library in the
planning of history outlines for club work,
in arranging for a public library selected
lists of histories suitable for "all sorts and
conditions of men," and similar tests that
show how far they are able to apply present
bibliographical knowledge to probable
future experiences.</p>

<p>All this instruction and opportunity for
practice in bibliography is not left to "the
chance instruction of enthusiastic instructors"
or to "the insistence of department
heads" to quote Mr. Kendric C. Babcock.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
It is definitely planned, it is systematically
carried out, there is definite progression
from year to year in the kind of bibliographical
work required, and it is directly
related to the specific and individual work
of every student. From time to time conferences
are held by the members of the
library staff and the instructors in history
and these conferences enable each department
to supplement and complement the
work of the other and thus avoid repetition
and duplication.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> <b>Library Journal</b>, March, 1913, p. 135.</p></div>

<p>This division of labor enables the reference
librarian to play the part of hostess,
to make the students feel at home,
to secure their good will and co-operation,
to develop a sense of personal responsibility
towards the library and its treasures.
Her work as regards the library is</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>
<p>largely general and descriptive; as regards
the students it is that of a friend and counselor;
as regards the other officers of the
college it is that of an ally and co-operator.</p>

<p>It is necessary to emphasize at this
point the wide divergence between the
work of the reference librarian in the college
or the university and that of the reference
librarian in the public library however
large or small it may be.</p>

<p>In the public library the demand made
upon the reference librarian is for definite
information for immediate use; the
library patron wishes, not training in acquiring
information by and for himself,
but the information itself; no substitution
of deferred dividends will satisfy his
insistent demand for immediate cash payment;
he cares not at all for method but
he cares very particularly for instant results.
Moreover, no one intervenes between
the reference librarian and the library
patron,&mdash;he alone is responsible for
giving the information desired. And again,
the reference librarian has to deal with
an irregular, constantly fluctuating clientele.
The man who wants to know who
first thought the world was round and
whether he was a vegetarian or perchance
a cannibal may never visit the library
again, but the effort must be made to satisfy
his curiosity. The reference librarian
of the public library must always be more
or less of a purveyor of miscellaneous information
to an irregular fluctuating public.</p>

<p>But the functions of the college reference
librarian are altogether different. It
is often his duty not to give, but temporarily
to withhold information; not to
answer but to ask questions; to answer
one question by asking another; to help a
student answer his own question for himself,
work out his own problems, and find
a way out of his difficulties; to show him
how to find for himself the material desired;
to give training rather than specific
information; to be himself a teacher
and to co-operate with other instructors in
training the students who seek his help.
All this is possible for him for he deals
with a regular constituency and he can
build up each year on the foundations of
the previous year. But while progression
comes for the students, there is always
the solid permanency of subject with
which the reference librarian deals. With
the regularity of the passing calendar
there come the questions of the feudal system
and of the frontier, of the renaissance
and of how to follow a bill through congress.
The personnel of the student body
changes, but there is always an unchanging
residuum of subject matter. On the
side of the regular college work there is
therefore practically no demand whatever
made on the college reference librarian for
the miscellaneous information demanded
of the public reference librarian,&mdash;he is
not the one who writes for the daily papers
the description in verse of the daily
life of the reference librarian.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Just what
his work is in the college, from the students'
point of view is indicated by a recent
experience.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> <b>Library Journal</b>, Oct., 1912. <b>Public Libraries</b>,
June, 1913.</p></div>

<p>A class of seventy in American history
was recently asked to what extent the
members of it had availed themselves of
the services of the reference librarian in
that particular course and the replies seem
to show that their inquiries had chiefly
related to the use of government publications,
early periodical literature, material
not suggested by the titles of books,
out-of-the-way material, source material,
and current newspaper material not available
through indexes. The many tributes
to the help received from the Vassar College
reference librarian are perhaps best
summed up, so it seems to the teacher, in
the statement of one student "she shows
you how to go about finding a book better
the next time."</p>

<p>If then it must be evident that the work
of the college reference librarian differs
widely from that of the public reference
librarian, it remains to consider specifically
what division of the field should be
made between the college reference librarian</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>
<p>and the college instructor. Here
a clear line of demarcation seems evident.
The college instructor must know
the student personally and intellectually,
as he must know the conditions from
which he has come and the conditions to
which he presumably is to go. He must
help the student relate all the various
parts of his college work and help him
relate his college work to the general
conditions in which he is placed. Hence
he cannot separate for the student the
bibliography of a subject from the subject
itself. Nor can he turn over to the librarian
the instruction in bibliographical
work. The reference librarian is the only
member of the library staff who in the
capacity of a teacher comes into direct
personal relationship with the student, but
his work, as has been seen, is entirely
different.</p>

<p>In this division of the field that leaves
to the college instructor the actual instruction
of students in the use of books,
a large unoccupied territory is claimed by
the reference librarian as peculiarly his
own. This concerns the "extra-collegiate
activities" and includes help on material
needed in inter-class debates, dramatics,
pageants, college publications, Bible
classes, mission classes, commencement
essays, and all the miscellaneous activities
in which the student, not the instructor,
takes the initiative. This work corresponds
somewhat closely to that of the
general reference librarian in a public library
and it demands about one-half of the
time of the librarian.</p>

<p>Instruction in the use of the library is
facilitated by unrestricted access to the
shelves and here the students are able to
put their knowledge to the test and to
work out their own independent methods.</p>

<p>What are the advantages and the disadvantages
of unrestricted access to the library
shelves? The question was recently
asked a class of seventy students and their
replies show an almost unanimous opinion
that the advantages are overwhelmingly in
favor of the open shelves.</p>

<p>Among the educational advantages enumerated
are that this fosters independence
and self-reliance, through encouraging personal
investigation; that it enables students
to see books in relation to other
books, to make comparisons, and therefore
to select those that are the best to use;
that it shows the library resources and, to
a certain extent, the breadth of the investigation
that has been done in specific
lines. "The open shelf is an instructor, a
great indispensable helper, an education in
itself," writes one student, while another
states, "It gives an opportunity to form
a closer acquaintance with books already
known by name, and for casual acquaintance
with books one has not time to draw
out and read at length."</p>

<p>On the more personal side the students
have found the advantages to be the pleasure
found in handling books; the appeal
made by titles and bindings; the inspiration
that comes from the feeling of kinship
with books; the opportunity given for
wide acquaintance with books and authors;
more extensive reading; the saving
of time; the satisfaction of being able to
find what is wanted, freedom from the limitations
of specific references. "We become
interested in subjects and in books
we should not otherwise have known at
all," writes one, while another asked a
friend who replied, "Well, I don't know
exactly what it means, but I guess it
means that I for one use books I never
otherwise would have used."</p>

<p>On the side of the library as a whole,
many have found advantages in the opportunity
it gives of doing general and special
bibliographical work and in the knowledge
afforded of the general plan of arrangement,
classification, and cataloging.
"If we had to stay in a reading room, how
much idea of library organization should
we have?" is the clinching question of one
enthusiastic student.</p>

<p>The moral advantages are found to be
the feeling of responsibility towards books
and the training given in not abusing the
privilege.</p>

<p>But it is in the failure of some persons
to avail themselves of these opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
for moral training that students find the
disadvantages of the open shelf. There are
the periodic complaints that books are lost,
misplaced, hidden, and monopolized; that
the privilege is abused; and that the social
conscience is lacking. "The open shelf is
the ideal system but it is designed for an
ideal society," feelingly writes one, while
another, more philosophical, finds that the
open shelf has its annoyances, but no disadvantages,
and that these are probably
to be charged up to human nature, not to
the system.</p>

<p>Only an occasional one sees any other
disadvantages. One student finds herself
bewildered and lost in irrelevant material,
while another brought up in the atmosphere
of Harvard, thinks that the closed
stack encourages greater precision and
carefulness, "for if you have to put in a
slip and wait for a book you are more careful
about your choice than you are when
you can easily drop one found to be unsatisfactory
and lay your hands immediately
upon another one." "It may be,"
adds a third, "that we do not get all we
might from a book when it is so easy to
get others. I find myself often putting
aside a book when I do not immediately
find what I want."</p>

<p>With an occasional plaint about the increased
noise and that the open shelf really
takes more time since it is easier to ask
for an authority on a specified subject than
it is to look it up for one's self, the case
for and against the open shelf, from the
side of the student, seems closed, with the
verdict overwhelmingly in favor of unrestricted
access to the library shelves.</p>

<p>I cannot forbear suggesting two directions
in which it seems to me the library
work could be extended to the advantage
of both library and academic force.</p>

<p>The first is the desirability of having
connected with every college library an instructor
in the department of history who
gives instruction in one or more courses in
history and who is at the same time definitely
responsible for the development of
the bibliographical side of the history
work.</p>

<p>The work of the history librarian on the
library side would be to serve as a consulting
expert on all questions that arise in
cataloging books that are on the border
lines between history and other subjects.
Such perplexing questions are constantly
arising and valuable aid might be given in
such cases by an expert in history.</p>

<p>Another part of the work of the history
librarian from the side of the library
would be to keep the librarian and the history
department constantly informed of opportunities
to purchase at advantage
works on history that are available only
through the second-hand dealers. It now
usually devolves on some member of the
library staff to study the catalogs of second-hand
books and report "finds" to some
officer of the history department. Could
facilities be provided for making it possible
to have the initiative come from the
history side it would seem a distinct gain.</p>

<p>The work of the history librarian would
also include the responsibility for the classification,
arrangement and care of the
mass of apparently miscellaneous material
that accumulates in every library but does
not slip naturally into a predestined place.
All is grist that comes to the history mill,
yet it is difficult to know how it can best
be cared for. Miss Hasse in her well-remembered
article <b>On the Classification
of Numismatics</b><a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> has shown that the utmost
diversity has prevailed in regard to the
classification of coins and the literary material
dealing with them. This is but one
illustration of the uncertainty, confusion,
and diversity that prevails in classifying
much of the material that seems miscellaneous
in character, and that yet should be
classified as historical material.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> <b>Library Journal</b>, September, 1904.</p></div>

<p>The work of the history librarian on the
side of the students would be concerned
during the first semester particularly with
the freshmen and the sophomores. The
bibliographical and reference work now
done could be greatly enlarged and extended.
It would be possible to explain
still more fully the possibilities of assistance
from the card catalog; to help students</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>
<p>locate the more special histories
that might seem to be luxuries rather than
the necessities of their work; to make
them acquainted with histories as histories,
rather than with histories as furnishing
specific material; to develop their
critical appreciation of books and their
judgment in regard to the varying degrees
of authoritativeness of well known old and
recent histories. Encouragement would be
given the students to begin historical libraries
for themselves, advice could be
given in making reasonable selections of
books, and help in starting a catalog. Interest
in suitable book-plates for historical
collections might be roused as well as interest
in suitable bindings, and thus
through these luxurious accessories the
student be led on to friendship with the
books themselves and with their author.</p>

<p>During the second semester the work of
the history librarian would be largely with
the seniors and would be more constructive
in its nature. The seniors are looking
forward to taking an active part in the
life of their home communities and they
will be interested in the public schools, in
the public library, in social work, in
church work, in history and literary clubs,
in historical pageants, f&ecirc;tes and excursions,
in historical museums, in the celebration
of historic days, and in innumerable
other civic activities, many of which
are intimately connected with the subject
of history. The history librarian would
be able to give invaluable aid to the seniors
in preparing lists of histories suitable
for public libraries in communities where
suggestions may prove welcome; in suggesting
histories adapted to all these demands
made by personal, co-operative, and
civic activities. This constructive work of
the history librarian would be capable of
infinite extension and variation and its
good results would be far-reaching and of
growing momentum.</p>

<p>May I suggest one further possible direction
in which the activities of the library
staff would lend interest to the general
work of the college. Every institution
needs luxuries and the members of the library
staff have it in their power to offer
courses of lectures open to all members of
the college and also to citizens of the community
who are interested in educational
questions. Such courses would include lectures
on the history of libraries; on the
great libraries of Europe and America; on
the great libraries of the world; on great
editors like Benjamin F. Stevens; on rare
books; on books famous for the number of
copies sold, of editions, of translations, of
migrations through auction rooms; on the
famous manuscripts of the world. The possibilities
of such courses are limitless.</p>

<p>There are also the courses of lectures
that we are all eager to hear on the plain
necessities that are of even greater interest
than are those that deal with the luxuries.
The college wants to hear about the
administration of a library and its general
problems; about the special questions of
cataloging, interlibrary loans, the special
collections of the library as well as its
general resources. From the standpoint of
special departments, lectures might be given
by representatives of these departments
on the treasures of the library as they concern
their special fields.</p>

<p>Joint department meetings of the members
of the library staff and the officers of
the departments of English and of history
for the discussion of questions of mutual
interest have at Vassar College proved
stimulating and contributed much to a mutual
understanding of each other's ideals
and to a sympathetic appreciation of the
difficulties attending their realization.</p>

<p>"Why cannot all this work with and
about books be explained by the librarians,&mdash;"
college authorities sometimes
ask. "That is their business; it is the
business of the teacher to teach."</p>

<p>The answer is simple. The good teacher
must individualize the student, the good
librarian must individualize the book; and
both teacher and librarian must co-operate
in helping the college student get the utmost
possible from his college course in
order that in his turn he may help the community
in which he lives in its efforts to
realize its ideals. The endless chain ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>tends
to the farthermost confines of
heaven!</p>

<p>Discussion of the paper was led by Mr.
J. T. Gerould, librarian of the University
of Minnesota. He believed that most college
teachers had neither the knowledge
nor the enthusiasm necessary to give systematic
bibliographic instruction. Training
in the use of the library should, he
thought be given by a member of the library
staff, from a general point of view,
introducing the student to reference books
not simply in one field, but in all. The
time had come for the university libraries
to define their position as a distinct educational
integer, not a mere adjunct to the
academic departments. Of course, to take
such a position, the library staff must be
thoroughly equipped, and must include
trained bibliographers in adequate number.</p>

<p>Dr. E. C. Richardson, librarian of Princeton
University, called attention to the fact
that the principle of unrestricted access to
the shelves required hearty co-operation
between the college public and the library
staff. It should be recognized that the librarian
is not responsible for the correct
placing of every book on an "open shelf."</p>

<p>Mr. John D. Wolcott, librarian of the Bureau
of Education, Washington, D. C.,
spoke of the questionnaire on the subject
under discussion sent out in October, 1912,
by the A. L. A. to two hundred colleges and
universities. A summary of the results
were included in the chapter entitled "Recent
aspects of library development" by
John D. Wolcott, which forms a part of the
Report of the U. S. Commissioner of Education
for the year ended June 30, 1912.
Reprints may be obtained from the Commissioner.</p>

<p>Mr. H. C. Prince, librarian of the Maine
state library, called attention to the
courses in legal bibliography which were
being given at various law schools. Those
at the University of Chicago, though without
credit, were eagerly attended by law
students.</p>

<p>Mr. Goodrich reiterated his belief that
the libraries should take a definite stand
in insisting that college students must be
taught how to use library resources to the
full. They must learn the many "tricks
of the trade," which in his opinion, were
better known at present to the librarian
than to the teacher. Miss Salmon replied
that she thought it less a question of learning
the "tricks of the trade" than of adapting
the desired knowledge to the individual
need and capacity of the student; hence
her belief in the teacher as the proper medium
of instruction. The discussion could
not be pursued for lack of time.</p>

<h3>SOME PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
REGARDING CLASSIFICATION
FOR LIBRARIES</h3>


<h4>I</h4>

<p>The letter inviting me to take part in
this conference echoes to me now across
the busy field of the past month with notes
something like this: "Come, if you will,
and talk to us and with us, but <b>please</b> be
<b>practical</b>." Perhaps I have elsewhere in-adroitly
given the impression that I believe
classification for libraries should be a matter
of science or of philosophy. I did indeed
say in print, some months ago, that
"To be practical today and tomorrow, man
must be scientific." Upon science, that is
verified and organized knowledge, practical
common sense is becoming more and
more dependent. To be practical without
knowledge is in most matters to be ineffectively
practical. How practical should
we be in classification for libraries, and
how should we be practical effectually?</p>

<p>Those who have had to do with classification
only in small collections of books
for popular use may regard it as a comparatively
simple and unimportant thing.
They do not see why there should be so
much trouble and fuss about it. This we
may term the na&iuml;ve view, to borrow a
phrase from recent philosophical literature.
But some of those who have undertaken
to maintain a classification for a
large university or reference library know
that it is one of the most difficult and com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>plicated
of our problems. They apprehend
furthermore that it has not yet been solved
satisfactorily. This may be termed the
<b>critical</b> view. It may vary from moderation
to extremes optimistic or pessimistic.</p>

<p>Not a toy librarians want but a <b>tool</b>, as
we say. The mechanism of a library, however,
is not operated by merely mechanical
hands. There should be somewhat in library
service beyond mere statistical and
technical economies. Our arrangement of
books should not be inconsistent with the
organization of knowledge, lest we fail in
an <b>inestimable</b> service to the seekers and
disseminators of knowledge.</p>


<h4>II</h4>

<p>Is it feasible economically to adapt this
instrument, classification, to that higher
service? There are three answers to this
question. There is the pessimistic negative.
Books are wanted in all possible and
impossible arrangements. You cannot
make a classification that, even with the
customary transfers of charging-systems,
will serve all these ever-varying needs.
This argument leads to the virtual negation
of the very <b>principle</b> of classification.
If this were wholly true, it were futile to
provide a place for bacteriology, for the
books would be wanted now under botany,
now under pathology, or sanitation, and
again perhaps under agricultural science.</p>

<p>Shall we separate such branches or not?
The pessimist says: "Whichever you do,
classification fails." The optimist answers:
"Good classification serves the average
or prevailing demand." To more special
subjects the pessimist then turns, such
as crystallography, eugenics, child-psychology.
These he says are claimed in their
entirety by two or three different sciences.
These arguments, launched against so-called
"scientific classifications," are no
less hostile to the worthy undertaking of a
practical system in such conformity to the
consensus of modern science as the conditions
permit. But most librarians have not
accepted this pessimistic negative. They
continue to classify books for average demands,
and the interest in the problem
increases.</p>

<p>Contrasted is the more prevalent optimistic
view. We have good classification.
The Decimal Classification is an admirable,
successful, at least serviceable system; it
is the established, the familiar, the most
practical. With all its faults, we love it
still. Is not that <b>na&iuml;ve</b>? Then, a consistent,
scientific system is an impossibility.
The relations and interests in science are
ever changing, always complex. The thing
would not continue for a decade to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>Another outcome of the na&iuml;ve optimistic
view, as realizing the complexity of scientific
specialization, is the doctrine that a
simple, practical system may be kept
abreast of scientific progress by the addition
of new details. This elaboration of
schedules is compatible with what we term
"expansion." Expansibility is essential to
the very life of a notation, but it may be
overworked. Certain systems have, I fear,
expanded beyond the capacity of their
safety valves to save them from explosion.
Thousands of the details of those inflated
schedules are practically useless even in
the largest library. Such abnormal distension
of the bibliographical body, or hypertrophy
of its special parts, is not now for
the first time called a disease of the bibliothecal
system. That the subjects and
topics are innumerable and of intricate
complexity has led to the misconception
that a classification for libraries should
embody an infinity of captions in infinite
complication. An alphabetical subject-index
is believed to be all that is requisite
to operate this maze of entangled details.
This view may be termed the <b>subject-index
illusion</b>.</p>

<p>Classification for libraries is to be distinguished
on the one hand from notation
and on the other hand from an arrangement
of bibliographical subjects indexed.
Notation and index are but correlative to
classification, and, however requisite to a
practical system, are in truth of minor importance.
They are the fingers and the
feet of the body and brain that organize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the materials of knowledge. Yet it is these
fingers and feet that have chiefly occupied
the attention of most classifiers.</p>

<p>In the theory of classification subjects
are to be distinguished from classes as contents
from containers. The subject is that
which is denoted by its definition; the
class is the aggregate of particular things&mdash;books,
or other things&mdash;that are comprised
by the definition. A class may be comprehensive
of many subjects or aspects of
subjects. Such need not appear in the
schedules of the classification, but they
should be in its subject-index. Thus, Botany
is a subject, to which Botanical Books
is the corresponding class; Plant Physiology,
a less general subject, has a less
comprehensive class of books. Geotropism
is a specific subject in the physiology of
plants. The question arises, is there a
class of books and pamphlets treating especially
of this subject, the tendency of
plants to respond to gravitation, as a stimulus?
"Have you in your library," I might
ask individually of the majority, "have you
an aggregation of books on this subject?"
The A. L. A. List comes nearest in the
sub-headings under Plants, where with
Movements appears Heliotropism, a kindred
subject. This caption Movements is
for a veritable class of subjects, and it
might indeed comprise Geotropism. That
is just what the Library of Congress schedule
does, subordinating under QK 771
"Movements, Irritability in plants, (general)",
the caption of 776, "Miscellaneous induced
movements: Geotropism, Heliotropism,
etc." In my own classification, the
mark GCM goes with the caption, "Movements,
Heliotropism, Geotropism, etc." It
seems well thus to provide for a future
group of monographs. If I criticise the Library
of Congress classification today, or
elsewhere, be it remembered that I recognize
its correct treatment of this and thousands
of other subjects. But is the E. C.
justified in reaching into the dim future
for subdivisions of specialization such as
its NESGD, Diatropism, and NESGL, "Lateral
Geotropism?" That is where we must
open the safety valve or burst.</p>

<p>The body of the D. C. is congested with
thousands of names of persons, places, and
events which may be subjects, but hardly
for classes of books. Systematic schedules
might provide for most of these, reduce
the bulk of the system, and make
for economy and convenience. The L. C.
schedules suffer from similar but more
astounding expansion. Class H, Sociology
and Economics, is needlessly immense,
having 551 p., of which but 51 are index.
According to the principle laid down a
moment ago, the number of subjects in the
index should by much <b>exceed</b> those in the
schedules.</p>

<p>The "Expansive" Seventh expansion expanded
so much with its own specialistic
tissue that it could afford to omit such bulk
of proper and place names. For instance
Aves (Birds), covers 8 pages of fine print;
there are all the taxonomic terms, for example,
PGSLPI is for Phalacrocoracid&aelig;,
some family related to the pelicans; but
there appears besides only the single subject
Oology (eggs), at the end as PGZ.
No place under Birds for their structure,
their habits, for the popular bird-books,
and for such interesting subjects as their
migration, flight, etc., about which there
<b>are</b> books! However much there is to
interest, to commend, and to admire in this
great undertaking, it must be admitted
that this is not practical classification for
libraries. It is the province of the subject-catalog
to bring together topics and
titles which are too special for classification
to bring into collocation.</p>

<p>But let us return to the main question
of the feasibility of <b>better</b> classification.
There are three answers, I said. Two we
have considered, the na&iuml;ve, and the pessimistic,
also their offspring, the subject-index
illusion, but we have not yet completely
answered the pessimistic. This
we may now proceed to do in connection
with the third answer, which is optimistic
and constructive, while at the same time
critical. This affirms that better classification
is feasible, that it may be sufficiently
flexible and durable, that changes
and adjustments may be provided for in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
alternative and reserved locations, that
the notation may be quite simple, and that
the index may be as full and specific as
comports with convenience.</p>

<p>The purpose of library classification is
to group books and to <b>collocate groups</b> for
the convenience of readers and students
in their <b>average wants</b>. It is not so much
for those who want a book, whose author
and subject are known, or any good book
on a particular subject; for such, the author
and subject-catalogs may suffice. But
classification is for those who want books,
in the plural, directly, without preliminary
handling of cards. Three types of such
wants are to be distinguished.</p>

<p>(1) To all libraries come (the prevalent
type) those who wish a few good books
on the subject, or a few facts to be found
in the standard books. They do not care
to fuss over the card-catalog. The reference
librarian, the selective lists, may
serve such wants, but close classification
usually does so most economically and
most satisfactorily. For very specific subjects,
however, the subject-catalog in the
large library may often best serve this
type and may make it less dependent upon
free access and close classification.</p>

<p>(2) The second type wants all the good
books treating of the subject especially.
From these the user himself is to make
selection according to his purpose or point
of view. Free access and classification
are here requisite. A bibliography, if
there be one, would be most likely an <i>embarras
de richesse</i>.</p>

<p>(3) The third type is that of exhaustive
research: all the available literature is
wanted, not only the books and pamphlets
treating especially of the subject, but also
those on related subjects and those of
broader scope. Subject-catalogs and bibliographies
are needed preliminaries, but
access, continued access to the books, is
the desideratum. It is for this type that
the most carefully guarded libraries give
access to their precious collections. Classification,
not merely any old kind of subject,
or close classification, but good, scientific,
close classification, based upon
good, consistent, broad classification, is
here of paramount importance. The test
comes when the student turns from the
special to the more general and the related
subjects, which are mostly in related
branches of science. The tendency to organization
in science is rapidly and surely
growing. The more consistent with the
consensus, to which studies on the average
are adapted, however original and divergent
their aim, the more convenient will be
the classification. It is in subordination
of the specific to the broader subject or
class and in collocation of related subjects
and subdivisions of classes that most
systems fail; and here that most classifiers
fail to understand either the fault or
the remedy.</p>

<p>The difficulties emphasized by the pessimist,
the overlapping of studies and the
rival claims, arise chiefly from improper
subordination. The material is common
to the several sciences because these are
portions differentiated from larger fields.
Child-psychology is part of Psychology.
The science and art of education are mainly
concerned with the mental. They are
related to Physiology and to Sociology as
Psychology is related. But to place Education
under Sociology, as is done by the
D. C. and the E. C. is to answer the relation
of second, not of first dependence, and
is as false as it were to put psychology under
sociology, to put the cart before the
horse. Education and Psychology are working
together, and their books should be
contiguous. How shall we arrange these
practically? Well, scientifically, in the order
of generality, thus:</p>

<p>
I   Anthropology.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">ID to IG Human physiology.</span><br />
<br />
J   Psychology.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">JN Social psychology.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">JO Child-psychology.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">JP Education.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">JQ Educational psychology.</span><br />
<br />
K  Sociology and Ethnology.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">KA Sociology.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">KE Ethnology.</span><br />
<br />
L  History.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>The principles of consistent subordination
and practical collocation should guide
the maker of a system, and his notes
should guide the classifier of books. Here
indeed should be a "code for classifiers"
more intimately articulated than in a separate
book. But herein lies the practical
art of classification, so to dispose classes,
divisions, and subdivisions, that they shall
produce a relative minimum of inconvenience
under the average conditions of
demand and a relative maximum of collocation
not only of special classes but of
general, as well as a degree of consistency
as high as practical conditions permit, and
ultimately, as an ideal, a consistency not
only with the pedagogic but with the philosophic
organization of knowledge. This
ideal, I believe, is not beyond approximate
realization.</p>

<p>This critical but optimistic view ascribes
the failure of library classifications
to the dispersion of related material under
subject, or close classification, without
proper subordination and collocation. The
subject-index, however useful to classifiers,
is of little value to students. I approve
close classification, but find it the
more unsatisfactory and baffling as it is
the less consistently adapted to good broad
classification, with good articulation of related
subjects according to predominating
interests, and with alternative locations
for flexibility to changes and for durability
in the progress of science.</p>


<h4>III</h4>

<p>Having answered the main question of
feasibility, we may now take up some minor
practical questions, first Notation. It
is not likely that reason shall soon remove
all traces of prejudice and controversy in
this matter. A few propositions, however,
are so reasonable that I think they will
be accepted. Notation should be brief
and simple. Its simplicity depends upon
its brevity, though also upon the familiarity
and homogeneity of its elements. Letters
give brevity. The capacity of three-letter
notation, allowing for omission of
all objectionable combinations, is about
15,000. Using letters and figures together
increases this capacity to about 25,000,
omitting confusing mixtures such as K7G
and 8B4. Since somewhat more than 10,000
subdivisions seem requisite, the question
reduces to this form: "Which is
simpler, notation of three letters, or of
five figures?" But figures, it is argued, are
more familiar. They may be so to bookkeepers,
but to the keepers of books!
Familiar here means familiar with the
numbers of the D. C. Then, are unmeaning
combinations like DAL or GWK really
more meaningless than numbers like
13859? On the other hand, isn't RAG easier
to see and to remember? But the argument,
so far as it is not merely prejudiced,
is childish. Such combinations as A1, 3B,
C42, and CF6, are hardly objectionable, and
may prove convenient and economical in
class-notation as they do in the author
numbers, with which librarians are so
friendly. Since they are come to stay, what
is the use of arguing for homogeneous
notation?</p>

<p>Notation is the more systematic and
economical where it reduces in part to
schedules applicable to the subdivision of
many classes or divisions. This feature
appeared to a minor extent in the "form
signs" of the D. C., but was carried out
extensively and complexly in the E. C. It
is apparent also in the L. C., but there is
more conspicuous by its absence through
hundreds of pages of names of countries,
places, and persons. Time does not permit
me to describe here the six schedules that
economize the system I have worked out:
Schedule 1, Mnemonic numerals, constant
throughout; Schedule 2, for subdivision by
countries, applicable under subjects, where-ever
desired; Schedule 3, for subdivisions
under countries and localities; Schedule 4,
for subjects under any language, except
the chief literary languages; Schedule 5,
for the chief literary languages; and
Schedule 6, for arranging the material under
any prominent author.</p>

<p>Some who admit the feasibility of better
classification object that a classification
modern for the present will be out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
date in a generation. This in new guise
is the familiar argument that it is useless
to clean the house today, for it will need
again to be cleaned next week&mdash;which all
good housewives say is an unreasonable
argument. It would be a pity to have fair
librarianship called a slouch.</p>

<p>Is it conceivable that your books shall
remain forever classified as they are at
present? Are there to be no changes,
merely additions of new captions? Conservatism
is not strange, considering the
cost of changing notation; but that cost
is small compared with the cost of new
building or new collections, and is justified
by the service to be rendered. The longer
postponed, the larger the cost, the larger
the burden. Some libraries are changing
now&mdash;to what? That change may indeed
have to be changed again in a decade or
two. But how long, then, should a classification
endure&mdash;or rather, be endurable?
One who would not prophesy may nevertheless
give an opinion. I believe that a
good classification should last a century&mdash;with
some minor alterations. I believe
that a good library should be willing to reclassify,
if necessary, at least some of its
collections two or three times in a century.
I think that library economy should
have been developed with better regard
to this problem. It is not practical to arrange
books inconsistently with the scientific
and pedagogic organization of
knowledge. Organization based on consensus
is one of the marked tendencies of
modern thought and purpose, and is not
likely to be overcome by dissenting or disintegrating
philosophical counter-tendencies.
This organization is more stable
than the theories on which it rests, and
these are more stable than the popular
press would lead us to suppose. New
theories, new statements, are assimilated
to the established body of knowledge without
much dislocation of members. Durability
in a system would depend not only
upon present consistency with the organization
of knowledge, but upon flexibility
through reserved and alternative locations,
judiciously chosen with regard to tendencies
in science. There might be flaws and
errors, but all practice, in whatever profession
is thus imperfect and tentative.</p>

<p>That the D. C. is antiquated is not because
of any change in science, but because
it did not conform to the science of
its generation. The welcome accorded to
it in the pioneer days was in keeping with
the earlier view that classification is a
simple thing, as it indeed was for the small
popular libraries. That acceptance has
mellowed now into an affectionate companionship
with a familiar and comfortable
conveyance that has proved serviceable so
far. Now the thing is said to need repair.
But that it cannot economically be reconstructed
has been recently demonstrated.
It evidently must go on till its thousand
pieces fall in a heap together, like the
"wonderful one-hoss shay." Loading it
with more and more scientific luggage may
for a time increase its service, but the
rattling of its parts grows all the more
distressing to those who ride.</p>

<p>I reserve my opinion of the Expansive
Classification and of that of the Library
of Congress. It is to the point to say,
however, that they are as unsatisfactory
in the major principles of practical and
scientific classification for libraries as they
are valuable and admirable in the details
which they have elaborated. They should
help to solve the ultimate problem; but,
if consistency with science and economy
with convenience are feasible and requisite,
neither of these systems is fit, nor is
either, I think, likely to endure in general
use in the future.</p>

<p>The simpler, the more systematic, and
the more consistent with the organization
of knowledge a classification and notation
is, the more economical and the less vexatious
will be the operation of classifying
books. The subject, scope, treatment, purpose
of the book&mdash;if that could be stated
beforehand&mdash;and why not?&mdash;by author and
publisher, and confirmed by the copyright
office or the national library, then the
class-notation could in most cases be
quickly found through subject-index. That
information might be printed in the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
and more readily found there than through
centralized cataloging and service of
cards. Centralized or co-operative classifying
however, or assigning of subjects and
of the class-marks of an elaborately classified
central or national library, would be
a service of high value and of very considerable
economy. <b>But</b> it should be distinguished
from standardized classification.
As libraries differ and differentiate,
so should their classifications. At best a
system may serve for libraries of a type,
but not for all types. A university need
not adopt an unfit classification as more
than one has done of recent years. It may
translate the centrally assigned subjects
and class-marks into its own system,
through its own index. Some general conformity,
or conformity in special parts,
may indeed prove economical and convenient,
but standardization of an elaborate
system is progress in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>This outline of a large, complex, and
unsolved problem of paramount importance
is very inadequate. I would propose
that a committee be constituted, to
articulate with the present committee on
a code for classifying, to set to work upon
a fuller investigation of this great question
of the feasibility of better and more economical
classification and notation. If
librarians do not provide better classification
for libraries, then the users of libraries
will very likely in the not remote
future provide for better librarians.</p>

<p>In the subsequent discussion, opened by
Dr. Richardson and by a paper written by
Mr. W. S. Merrill, chief classifier of the
Newberry library, Chicago, exception was
taken to many of Mr. Bliss' criticisms of
present classifications. It was pointed out
that the D. C., with all its faults, was yet
eminently practical, as evidenced by its
widespread use. Mr. Cutter stated that
the E. C. classification for zoology, which
Mr. Bliss had specially criticised, had been
made in just the way Mr. Bliss himself regarded
as the soundest, i. e., it had been
condensed from material furnished by an
eminent scientist; as to its being over minute,
it was expanded only half as much
as the scientist had proposed. Mr. Charles
Martel, chief of the catalog division in the
Library of Congress, Dr. Andrews, librarian
of the John Crerar library, Chicago,
and others also expressed their belief in
close classification as a safeguard against
confusion and unscientific grouping.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes remained for a paper
on "Art in the college library," by Mr.
FRANK WEITENKAMPF, chief of the art
department, New York public library.</p>


<h3>ART IN THE COLLEGE LIBRARY</h3>

<p>The problem of art in schools has been
frequently discussed. The matter of art
in colleges, apparently, has not been so
much considered. The cases, however,
seem to be dissimilar only in degree, not
in kind. In fact, not a little of the material
that has been suggested for schoolroom
decoration would be equally in place in
the college. For instance, names such as
those of Gozzoli or Luca della Robbia, on
the <b>Craftsman's</b> list for schools could just
as well be suggested for the college. Also,
the average student is probably first to be
reached best by recognition of the fact that
there are other interests beside the purely
aesthetic. In other words, good use can
be made of the subject picture, the best
possible being chosen. Dr. W. D. Johnston,
librarian of Columbia University,
where exhibitions "have always been an
important auxiliary of lectures" and have
included exhibitions of graphic arts, states
that these last "are selected and displayed
less with a view to artistic than pictorial
value." But he adds that more and more
attention is given to artistic value, and
that in his belief the most valuable exhibits
of an artistic nature are those "displayed
permanently on the walls of halls,
seminar rooms and lecture rooms. On the
other hand, those which are exhibited temporarily
should, if well selected, and well
announced, do much to broaden taste."</p>

<p>The permanent display of pictures which
illustrate with distinction certain broad
principles of taste, is of undoubted necessity.
But the use of the temporary show
must not be lost sight of. The oft seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
easily becomes the oft unheeded; familiarity
breeds contempt. Periodical changes
therefore seem advisable, as evidence that
there is "something doing." Loans of
good prints from private sources, if advisable,
might be utilized to excellent effect.
For instance, if the library happens
to own, or can borrow, a copy of such a
publication of color reproductions as the
Medici prints, or "Meister der Farbe" or
"Alte Meister" (the latter two issued by
Seemann of Leipzig), a number of plates
from the same might be placed on exhibition
for, say, three months. This might
be followed by a six-weeks' black-and-white
show of good etchings from a private
collection, or from the stock of the nearest
museum or print dealer. After that,
perhaps, a show of Greek art. The guiding
principles should be: Keep the exhibit
within reasonable bounds as to numbers,
make selection with as much discrimination
as circumstances will permit, and see
that what you offer is made palatable. Dr.
E. C. Richardson of the Princeton University
library tells me that there a large
collection of art photographs is drawn upon
for permanent exhibition, the latter rearranged
"every now and then" in order to
exhibit fresh material, and that there have
been a number of special exhibitions. (Incidentally,
this university has a great variety
of undergraduate courses in art.)</p>

<p>The matter of proper presentation is
important. Not what is seen, but what is
digested, counts. Good labels are a necessity;
summary, with as little dryness as
possible, informative, so that the student
may see at a glance why a given picture
was shown, and what are its good points.
If relation to studies can be brought out in
these exhibits, all the better. That naturally
suggests the possibility of an occasional
display of pictures illustrating a given
period or personality in a given country.
In the recently-printed little volume,
"Art museums and schools," containing
four lectures by Stockton Oxson, Kenyon
Cox, Stanley Hall and Oliver S. Tonks, the
significance of the museum to teachers of
English, art, history and the classics is
considered, and the documentary value of
art is properly emphasized. "In order to
teach the classics," says Prof. Tonks, "you
must know more of ancient life than is
to be gleaned from the literature by itself."
Viewed in this light, the old Greek vases
and other art objects take on a new significance.
But the ultimate object of all
this must not be lost to sight, the cultural
influence sought, the promotion of interest
in art as a matter not apart from, but
a part of, our daily life, a contribution to
general culture. It is well to make it clear
that a certain amount of appreciation of
art can become as much a matter of course
as certain elementary rules of good breeding.
"Art," says Croly, in his "Promise
of American life,"&mdash;"art cannot become a
power in a community unless many of its
members are possessed of a native and
innocent love of beautiful things." These
considerations, again, suggest the occasional
exhibiting of plates illustrating decorative
and applied art, say color plates
such as those in Wenzel's "Modern decorative
art," or "Dekorative Vorbilder," or
similar books, if procurable, or black-and-white
plates from books or art magazines.
A judicious use of the library's books is
advisable, not through lengthy lists in
which the bibliographical instincts of the
librarian might find vent. Reference to
two or three books on a subject&mdash;whetting
the appetite by displaying them at the
same time as the plates exhibited&mdash;may
lead to an occasional reading at spare
moments. It may help also to show the
fallacy of the "I don't know anything of
art, but I know just what I like" attitude.
You can not understand anything worth understanding
without some trouble, any
more than you can play football or bridge
without some practice.</p>

<p>The matter of hanging must depend,
naturally, on local conditions: amount and
distribution and shape and location of
available wall space or other space, financial
resources, character of student body,
etc. The simplest method is, of course, to
suspend the pictures by clips from horizontal
wires, but it is not under all cir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>cumstances
the safest. Pictures may be
fastened to a wooden background (usually
covered with burlap or other textile)
on the wall. In that case, care must of
course be taken that thumb-tacks do not
pass through the print. The shank of
the tack passes close to the picture upon
the outermost margin of which its head
will then press. Mr. E. R. Smith of the
Avery library at Columbia University, lays
strips of bristol board over the spaces between
the pictures, and overlapping the
margins of the same; the tacks pass
through these strips. Pictures fastened
to the wall may be covered by sheets of
glass held in place by strong tacks, or perhaps
the brass-headed upholsterers' nails.
Where prints are shown unprotected it
may prove well to mount them, unless they
are printed on thick and strong paper. (At
the Newark library they use mounting
board bound at the edge with buckram
and further strengthened by pigskin corners;
this is for prints which circulate
among teachers.) Where frames are used
with the intention of periodical or occasional
change of exhibits, the back can be
held by the familiar "button" device which
can be easily swung aside so as to admit
of changing the picture without extracting
nails. Mr. Paul Brockett of the
Smithsonian Institution, tells me that there
the glass doors of bookcases have been
used for exhibiting pictures. At the same
place, wing frames&mdash;that space-saving device
of a dozen frames with glass centered
on a standard, and having a certain
swing in either direction&mdash;have been used.
Moreover, these frames were units which
could be hung on the standard or placed
against the wall. In some of the New York
public library's branches, such frames
radiate directly from the wall, to save
space. A similar device is seen in a certain
type of display fixtures, in which the
swinging frames reach to the floor, and
which may be seen in operation in the
lithographic exhibition of Fuchs &amp; Lang,
Warren St., New York City. There is
no protecting glass here, however, and I
presume that the use of this contrivance
would be safe only in exceptional cases.
Hints to exhibitors may be found in articles
such as the one on "Mounting, framing
and hanging pictures," by Miss Mabel J.
Chase, assistant supervisor of drawing,
Newark, N. J., in the <b>School Arts Magazine</b>
for December, 1912, or in one on
"Planning and mounting an exhibit" in
the number for March, 1913, by George W.
Eggers, who lays stress on the fact that
"Every exhibit should definitely tell something."
Still continuing the examination
of this magazine, one notes in the issue
of April, 1913, an article on the "Decoration
of an assembly hall in R. C. Ingraham
Grammar school, New Bedford,
Mass." That relates to a permanent exhibit,
and describes the distribution of
pictures and other objects in such a manner
as to make a harmonious arrangement
of the whole room. But there are other
periodicals, and there are readers' guides
and other indexes and bibliographical
aids, and this is not the place for lists.</p>

<p>Now, as to the material to be used for
the exhibition. Outside of the resources
offered by the library's own collection and
the loan possibilities indicated, there are
various dealers and other agencies to be
taken into account. In the state of New
York for instance, the division of Visual
Instruction of the Education department
has a circulating collection of pictures
furnishing ample material for educational
extension lectures and for study clubs.
This consists of "Braun, Elson, Hanfst&auml;ngel
and Hegger carbons, Copley prints
and bromides and Berlin photogravures."
These wall-pictures are lent to schools and
libraries, framed without glass, for a fee
of 50 cents each per year. In other states,
I presume state library commissions could
give advice. There are the artistic lithographic
drawings in color issued by B. G.
Teubner of Leipzig at five and six marks
apiece, the plates of Seemann's "Meister
der Farbe" can be purchased separately,
and dealers such as the Berlin Photographic
Co., George Busse, the Detroit Publishing
Co., Braun Clement &amp; Co. and others
could no doubt give lists and advice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Importing book-dealers, French and German,
must be considered. Not all of the
material furnished by these concerns is
equally cheap, but a certain amount of the
higher-priced sort will serve for permanent
exhibit.</p>

<p>Part 6, devoted to the art department,
in John Cotton Dana's "Modern American
library economy," is a very useful guide,
not only in its record of accomplishment
at Newark, but also in its hints as to
sources, its list of addresses. Miss Ethelred
Abbot's "List of photograph dealers"
(Massachusetts Library Club, 1907) is
properly emphasized for its usefulness, as
is also the "Bibliotheca p&aelig;dagogica."</p>

<p>For permanent exhibits the reproductions
of certain examples in architecture,
painting and sculpture which have become
classical, are of obvious value. And here,
too, the reason for inclusion may well be
emphasized to the student, not only by
proper labels but also by reference at the
proper time in the classroom and lecture
hall. Such classics in art will not infrequently
be found reproduced better in
black-and-white than in color. Should the
library decide to procure color work by
modern artists, such as the Teubner prints
referred to, or the similar ones issued by
Voigtl&auml;nder or by the K&uuml;nstlerbund of
Karlsruhe, care must be taken to select
such as are of general, and not merely
local, interest. Say for example, the well
known "Field of grain" by Volkmann. Such
modern work also has the advantage of
emphasizing the fact that there is work
worth while being done today. It likewise
shows the healthy tendency to enlarge
acquaintance with home production,
home scenery, home customs. We find
that, for instance, in Germany, in Sweden,
to a certain extent in England, and elsewhere.
Much of the foreign endeavor in
this direction has found its use in schools,
but it involves some big principles in point
of view which make a certain amount of
its results of use in the college as well.
But we should similarly pay attention to
the best American work. Noteworthy attempts
by American artists to interpret
American life and the beauties of our scenery
deserve support. One notes with interest
the attempt made by the American
Federation of Arts' Committee on Art in
the Public Schools to call attention to
American examples in the fine arts by
calling for an expression of opinion as to
the best works produced by our artists.
T. W. Stevens reported that the Chicago
Institution, furthering the utilization of
students' work in the decoration of public
school walls, "encouraged the adoption
of subject pictures for decoration; especially
subjects in American history."</p>

<p>The help of the art department, where
the college has one, may well be enlisted.
(Parenthetically let me state that E. Baldwin
Smith in his recent report on "The
study of the history of art in the colleges
and universities of the United States,"
Princeton, 1911, summarizes his statistics
in the statement that of 1,000,000 students,
163,000 have any art courses at all
offered them.) Not only have we such
rich collections as those of the Avery Architectural
library at Columbia, the Fogg
Museum at Harvard, or Yale University,
but collections of casts, photographs and
books will be found at the disposal of the
art departments of a number of other colleges.
Such resources might be drawn upon
so that some modicum, at least, of art
influence may be extended to the rest of
the institution. If the direct co-operation
of the art department is secured it must
necessarily be adapted to the needs of the
case with a clear understanding of the
fact that general students, and not art students,
are to be served. The statement of
Dr. Leigh H. Hunt, associate professor of
art at the College of the City of New York
is of interest here. His 6,000 boys, says
he, would like to begin with the human
face. They do not necessarily lean to the
saccharine, but perceive human interest
shown without the aid of the direct anecdote.
They stand Memling and Ghirlandajo.
"The boys love color," he continues,
"and are easily led to love refined color.
They admire the early English water colorists&mdash;Cox,
DeWint; also, Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
prints." After becoming interested in
such refined color, they get a liking for
monochromes&mdash;delft blue landscapes, sanguines
and sepia drawings.</p>

<p>Efforts such as those I have indicated
seem particularly called for where the college
is away from art influences. But they
should not be put aside even where the college
is located in a larger center with an
art life. Rather should the resources near
at hand be turned to advantage. I have
seen the statement that over 30 per cent
of our museums are connected with educational
institutions. Also, in a large city,
there are numerous art exhibitions, most
varied in character. But the very extent
of all these opportunities may serve to
keep away the student who has so many
other duties and attractions. And, as Prof.
Hunt points out, boys living at one end of
a large city not only whirl past all such
possibilities on their way to college, but
in New York, using the subway, they pass
under it and not through it. What is
wanted is the direct, unavoidable presentation
of art to those who are not yet
sufficiently interested to seek art for themselves.</p>

<p>In the whole matter the ever-necessary
exercise of common sense is commendable.
Enthusiasm for the cause must be moderated
and adapted to the point of view of the
student. The didactic element should be
unobtrusive. The student should be interested
rather than admonished. Above all
he should be led to see that a certain love
and appreciation of art is not a "highbrow"
affair but a proper, necessary and pleasure-giving
part of the equipment of the
cultured man. As proper and a matter of
course as the avoidance of a necktie of
shrieking colors, or as the use of the table
knife for cutting only. Farther discussion
of this subject, as well as decision as
to the practicability of the ideas advanced,
must be left to those who have a more intimate
acquaintance with the problems,
conditions and difficulties involved than
can be had by one who has to deal with
the readers in a large public library.</p>

<p>Mr. Goodrich called attention to the library
of the University of Michigan as one
place where ideas like those of the paper
had been carried out, made a plea for
color prints as against the everlasting
black and brown, and suggested the possibilities
of pottery and textiles in the way
of giving life and cheer to the delivery
hall. He referred by way of example to
the beautiful drapery curtains in the John
Hay library reading room&mdash;a vast relief
from the ordinary roller shade and just as
effectual.</p>

<p>At the end of the session, the nominating
committee brought in the name of Mr.
W. N. C. Carlton, librarian of the Newberry
library, to succeed Mr. Keogh on the
committee on arrangements; Mr. Carlton
was unanimously elected. His term will
be three years; the other members of the
committee, Miss Askew and Mr. Goodrich,
remain the same as this year. The session
then adjourned until Friday night.</p>


<h3>COLLEGE LIBRARIANS'
ROUND TABLE</h3>

<p>The round table for college librarians
was held on Friday evening, June 27th.
F. C. Hicks, of Columbia university, presiding.</p>

<p>Miss JOSEPHINE A. RATHBONE, of
the Pratt Institute school of library science
gave a talk on</p>


<h3>WHAT COLLEGE LIBRARIANS CAN DO
FOR LIBRARY SCHOOLS</h3>

<p>In a recent lecture on administrative
problems of the college library given to the
students of the Pratt Institute library
school the lecturer pictured the ideal college
library of the future, with a staff consisting
of specialists, each with a knowledge
of his subject equal to that of instructors
or professors plus a library school
training, whose recompense should be on
the same scale as that for the teaching of
those subjects. I remarked afterward that
before that vision could come to pass the
college librarians should have to act as
feeders for the library schools, turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
toward librarianship promising material
from which the library schools could make
the college library specialist of tomorrow.
Hence this paper.</p>

<p>There has been a good deal of discussion
in the Professional Training section about
specialization in library schools&mdash;the desirability
of having special courses to prepare
librarians for technical libraries, for professional
libraries, for legislative reference
libraries, etc., etc., but I am convinced&mdash;and
my conviction deepens with my increasing
experience&mdash;that the time for specialization
is before the library school
course and not during it. Theoretically it
does not seem possible that the same
library course should be able to fit students
for such different lines as children's work,
municipal reference work, cataloging,
branch library work, the scientific department
of a university library, a botanical
garden library, and the librarianship of a
town library, but actually that is just what
happens; recent graduates of our school
are filling just such positions and each one
found that her library training plus her
previous education, experience and temperament
enabled her to fill the special position
satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Now what the college librarian can do
for the library school and hence for the
library profession, is, it seems to me, to
make it known among college students that
there are opportunities for the specialist
in library work&mdash;to disabuse the mind
of the man or woman who wants to pursue
economics or sociology or some branch of
science of the idea&mdash;almost a fixed idea it
would seem&mdash;that a specialist in order
to continue in his specialty must necessarily
teach it, that teaching offers the
only pied a terre, the only means of support
for the student. Students of sociology
and government are beginning to find their
way into organized welfare work, it is
true, but library work should be presented
to them as a means of social service, of
at least equal importance with settlement
work or organized charity. That it could
be so presented I am confident, and by
whom if not by or through the agency of
the college librarian?</p>

<p>Schools and colleges are devoting an increasing
amount of attention to vocational
guidance. Will not college librarians make
a point of seeing that the possibilities and
diversified opportunities of librarianship
are presented to the students each year?
If they do not care to do this themselves,
librarians or members of library school
faculties might be found in the vicinity
who would be glad to do it.</p>

<p>Once the subject of librarianship is presented
to the student and the desirability
of entering upon the work through the
gateway of library school training is
pointed out (I assume that no time need
be spent arguing this point&mdash;but if I am
wrong I shall be glad to discuss the matter
with any dissenters later), the college
librarian can further the cause by being
prepared to advise students as to their
choice of a library school. The college
librarian should supply himself with the
circulars of the several schools and should
inform himself concerning the reputation,
advantages, requirements, and specialties
of the different schools. We all agree that
there is no one best library school (except
our own), but that each of them offer
special opportunities that make them
adapted to the particular needs of different
students. To direct the inquirer to that
school that will best fit him for the particular
kind of work he inclines toward would
be to serve the profession, the schools, the
colleges, and the individual student. Will
not the college librarian take this function
upon himself and enrich the profession
not only with the quiet bookish student
who will develop into the old-fashioned
librarian for whom there is still
room, but with the specialist, the executive,
the vigorous and enthusiastic altruist
who wants to serve the world by positive,
constructive, social work?</p>

<h3>THE COLLEGE LIBRARY AND
RESEARCH WORK</h3>

<p>There was published in 1912 a "Union
List of Collections on European History
in American Libraries, compiled for the
Committee on Bibliography of the American
Historical Association by E. C. Richardson,
Chairman."</p>

<p>In the preface to this exceedingly valuable
work occurs the following extract
from the Report of the Committee, December,
1911:</p>

<p>"It is clear from this situation that no
library is self-sufficient&mdash;even Harvard
lacking 930 sets, and all but 12 lacking on
the average of 2,153 out of 2,197 works.
Even as good colleges as Amherst and Williams,
having but 26 and 17 respectively,
lack 2,171 and 2,180 respectively out of
2,197, while probably 700 of the 786 institutions
doing work of college grade in the
United States are worse off than these."</p>

<p>I need hardly say that this is merely a
statement of fact and in no sense a criticism
or arraignment of any library mentioned
or implied. Furthermore, it is undoubtedly
true that analysis and reflection
will render this statement much less startling
than it appears at first glance.
Whether we can explain and account for
it to our entire satisfaction is a question
which seems to me rather doubtful. Let
me quote a little more from this same
source:</p>

<p>"The most significant fact of the statistics
of last year remains, however, substantially
unchanged&mdash;the fact that only
ten or a dozen libraries have as many as
10 per cent of the collections, and that out
of 786 institutions which profess to do
work of college grade, only about fifty libraries
have as much as 1 per cent. The
actual situation is even much worse than
appears from the figures, since two or
three inexpensive volumes of illustrative
source books for classroom use are in the
list through inadvertence, and undoubtedly
swell the record of the minor institutions.
It is safe to say that a majority
even of the institutions included in the
Babcock list have less than one-tenth of
1 per cent of these sets, and yet these are
titles which have been gathered from actual
references and are the books which
are liable to meet any men engaged in historical
research at every turn."</p>

<p>If we assume that research work belongs
only to the university&mdash;that it has no place
in the college&mdash;we may dismiss these figures
as possessing no significance for us,
save as they throw some light on the inferior
quality of the collections built
up by most of our American libraries. If
on the other hand we believe that the
smaller institution should encourage its
teachers to do research work, and should,
so far as its resources allow, provide the
facilities for such work, then I believe that
a study of the conditions responsible for
the situation set forth in the Committee's
report cannot fail to be of some value. And
while I hold no brief for the research
worker I am strongly of the opinion that
the college which does encourage original
research can not but gain a higher quality
of teaching, and at the same time acquire
a collection of books which, if not notable,
shall be at least thoroughly good.</p>

<p>It may be claimed, and in that case
must be granted, that such a question as
this is practically an academic one, and so
pretty largely outside of the librarian's
province. That is true, however, only so
long as you leave the question unanswered&mdash;or
answer it in the negative. An affirmative
answer would bring the matter home
directly to every college librarian in the
country. The college which believes in
research and encourages its faculty to do
it, must have a librarian not only in sympathy
with the movement, but one skillful
in finding ways and means to make it a
success, since in most cases the funds at
our disposal for the purchase of books
would seem to preclude the possibility of
such a thing.</p>

<p>Before going further into the discussion
of this phase of the question, let me return
for a moment to the report from
which I quoted. One or two conclusions
may justly be drawn from the figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
therein presented. In the first place I
think we may safely infer that the situation
as regards History, so strikingly set
forth, is repeated, and probably in an even
worse form, in all the other departments of
knowledge. Certainly we should not expect
a library which was so weak in the
research material of History, to be any
stronger in Philology or the Sciences, or
in Philosophy and Economics.</p>

<p>The second conclusion follows naturally
from this, that the average college library&mdash;for
it is with the college library that this
paper concerns itself&mdash;has built up its collection
with practically no emphasis on
the acquisition of such material.</p>

<p>To say that this general condition exists
solely because of the lack of funds is to
my mind neither a real explanation, nor
a real excuse. It exists primarily because
there has never been any pressure from
members of the faculty to bring about a
different condition.</p>

<p>If we seek a reason for it we shall find
it in the fact that research work has by
tacit consent been left almost entirely to
the university. Its place there&mdash;its vital
importance in the university scheme of
work&mdash;has never been questioned. Making
all allowance for the difference in conditions
I still cannot see why a thing that
is confessedly of so much benefit to the
university should not also be of help to
the college. At the risk of getting a little
off the track, and for the sake of making
what I mean as plain as possible, it seems
necessary to devote some space to a definition
of the term research work. I am
writing, of course, from the standpoint of
an outsider, who expresses a purely personal
opinion on a subject which interests
him. There can be no hard and fast
definition of such a term as this&mdash;at least
not from a librarian.</p>

<p>I shall suppose then, that research work
is of two kinds, both important, but one
of them much more important than the
other. The first and most common kind is
that ordinarily done by the graduate student
in the university. It is the gathering
of material&mdash;the collection of information
on some particular phase of some particular
subject&mdash;and is not only of value in
itself, but when taken together with the
work done by other students along related
lines becomes part of the structure on
which scholarship is built. We may call
it analytical research work. The other
kind is that done by the man of clear
vision and wide outlook, mature enough to
see that the analytical work is merely
material for a bigger thing&mdash;call it what
you will&mdash;the man who can take the information
others have collected and impart
it in the form of culture. This is synthetic
research work. Now the university has
much of the former, some of the latter. The
college has need only of the synthetic. If
its place in the educational world is to be
permanent, its contribution to education
must be cultural. The type of teacher it
needs, and I believe must have, is the man
who has done, or is capable of doing, synthetic
research work. In his hands teaching
takes on a vitality, a spontaneity, a genuineness
that no one else can give it. That
the book collection of the average college
would be sufficient for the needs of men
like this is out of the question. There
would inevitably arise a demand for the
purchase of works of an entirely different
kind&mdash;a demand that would have to be at
least partially met. This demand would
be for research material, by which I mean
the results of research work, and the problem
of such a college library would become
a problem in discrimination&mdash;the decision
as to what of this material it should try
to obtain.</p>

<p>It ought not to be difficult to draw a
clear distinction between analytical and
synthetic research material. Illustrations
of the first will readily occur to you, one
as good as any being the usual thesis submitted
for the doctor's degree. All "source"
material is necessarily analytical&mdash;is the
result of a careful, painstaking, often laborious
search for information: information
that may illuminate some dark corner of
the field of knowledge. But it is never
itself illumined by the spark of genius,
nor wrought by the loving hand of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
artist. It is merely the wood and the stone
out of which a complete structure may
some day arise.</p>

<p>Now how does the synthetic conception
of research apply to History? A modern
German writer has compressed the whole
significance of it into a sentence: "The
writing of History," he says, "is just as
truly a <b>will toward a picture</b> as it is a
knowledge of sources." In other words
synthesis of the kind referred to is always
the work of the artist, and in the nature of
things becomes thereby a contribution to
culture. Gibbon's "Decline and fall of the
Roman empire," Lamprecht's "History of
Germany," Rhodes' "History of the United
States"&mdash;these are all synthetic: each one
existed first as a picture in the mind of the
artist, not merely as an array of sources
from which the facts of history might be
drawn.</p>

<p>"But," you say, "all libraries buy these
books and others like them as a matter of
course." Yes, we do, but I think the trouble
is that we do not make books of this
sort our standard, if indeed we have any
standard beyond a favorable review or a
request from a patron. It is no more true
that the result of all synthetic research is
cultural than that the result of all artistic
endeavor is beautiful. Results here are
just as uneven as anywhere else, with
much that is good and perhaps even more
that is bad, and it is when we come to
discriminate that we are apt to go astray.
Now a teacher such as I have in mind
would keep abreast through the better
periodicals of all that was being done in
his particular line, and if facilities were
furnished, would buy what he knew he
needed&mdash;monographs, bibliographies, biographies,
and some larger works&mdash;things
that would not only give his teaching a
vitality and freshness otherwise lacking,
but would help to hasten the day when his
own contribution to the world's culture
should see the light.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, that a college accepts
this view, and proposes to encourage its
faculty to do research work, what are the
practical ways in which the library can not
only co-operate, but further such an undertaking?
For I believe there are several.
A preliminary statement as to the functions
of the college library would seem to
be essential. These have often been set
forth for us in detail, and I shall only
enumerate them here. The first and most
important function is, of course, to meet
the needs of the students and teachers
as they arise in the regular college work.
Along with this is the supplying of books
for general reading, outside of the curriculum.
Most of these books are bought for
members of the faculty, who are thereby
enabled to keep in touch with the latest
developments in their own and other
fields, and to avoid the possibility of mental
stagnation from too close association
with a particular subject. I believe much
more might&mdash;and should&mdash;be done in the
way of developing a taste for general reading
on the part of the students, but that
is another story.</p>

<p>Apart from these what are the functions
of the college library? To be, so far as it
can the centre of culture for the community
in which it is located: to aid the
local public library in its work with woman's
clubs, and high school pupils: to
lend books freely to other libraries. And
in our own case there is the added opportunity
of being of some assistance to another
institution in the same town.</p>

<p>Now these things are all important, and
the librarian who does not realize it, who
fails to utilize to the utmost the possibilities
they contain for intellectual and social
betterment, is not worthy of his hire. But
the point of view I take in this article compels
me to consider them as secondary.
The college library exists first of all to
supply the book needs of its own students
and faculty, and for nothing else. The expenditure
of its funds, always insufficient,
must be limited to this chief function. It
is probable that all these other things I
have enumerated can be done without any
financial loss to the library, but where
any of them means a diversion of library
funds it becomes unjustifiable.</p>

<p>I said above that there are several prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>tical
ways in which a library&mdash;more properly,
perhaps, a librarian&mdash;can not only co-operate,
but further a movement to encourage
research work on the part of members
of the faculty. My remarks are of
necessity limited to my observation of
conditions in the institution with which I
am connected, and are not to be considered
general in their application. At the same
time, I am inclined to think that these
conditions are reproduced, at least to a
certain extent, in most college libraries.</p>

<p>The assistance which the library can
render must, of course, be very largely
financial. Only by releasing funds from
present uses, or by increasing these funds,
can we hope to buy material of the kind
referred to.</p>

<p>I am convinced, in the first place, that
we can save money in the purchase of
books, and this not through better discounts,
or any choice of agents, but
through more care in the selection of the
books themselves. In other words, submit
all lists of proposed purchases to a
more rigid scrutiny. Make all titles answer
such questions as "Is this book going
to be of real value to this library?" "Is
its usefulness to be more or less permanent,
or merely temporary?" "Could not
our need for it be met by borrowing from
another library?"</p>

<p>In our own case, at least, I fear a number
of books are recommended by professors
or others, and bought by the library,
which could not survive any such
test. This naturally applies not so much
to department books as to those of a general
nature, for in the last analysis the
teacher must be the judge of what he
needs to help him in his work.</p>

<p>Secondly, we ought to save money&mdash;I
think a considerable sum&mdash;on our periodicals.
And here the saving effected by
dropping some from the list is a double
one; not only the subscription price, but
the cost of binding. I realize that I am
treading on dangerous ground in this matter,
and that most professors would say to
drop all the books if necessary, but none
of the periodicals. And I could wish for
enough space to elaborate my side of the
question at some length, instead of touching
on it only briefly. For I believe it to
be of real importance&mdash;a thing that every
college library must face and decide at
some time or other. Here at Amherst we
spent last year over 40 per cent of the income
from our book funds on periodicals
and their binding&mdash;a proportion which I
cannot believe to be justified. Is there
not such a thing as a "periodical" habit,
into which all of us, librarians and professors
alike, are apt to fall? We keep
periodicals on our lists because they have
always been there&mdash;were there before we
came&mdash;although on reflection we are sure
that no one ever uses them&mdash;not even the
professor at whose instance they were
ordered. In the first place, of course, he
<b>expects</b> to use them, sometime if not now.
Or he is sure that he <b>ought</b> to&mdash;that they
would give him just the impetus he needs
in his work. Or perhaps (and I should
whisper this) he likes to have it known
that the department is taking these things
"couldn't get along without them." Now
the periodical that cannot prove its right&mdash;in
terms of usefulness&mdash;to be on the
shelves of a college library has no place
there. And the significance of this for us
is the fact that in being there it is keeping
something else out! What we spend
for it, and for others like it, would enable
us to make at least a beginning on
the acquisition of our synthetic research
material.</p>

<p>These are two of the ways in which it
seems to me a librarian in sympathy with
this movement could further it. Another,
possibly worth mentioning, is to refrain
from binding miscellaneous pamphlets and
other unbound material, mostly presented
to the library, and which we are apt to
think may some day serve a purpose. Part
of it may&mdash;most of it can well be thrown
away and the binding money saved.</p>

<p>"But," you say, "even in the aggregate
these things do not mean very much; perhaps
one or two hundred dollars at the
outside&mdash;one or two or three research collections
a year for your library." No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
they do not mean very much, by themselves,
or in the purchasing power of
money they are instrumental in saving.
But they stand for something definite and
logical; they are indicative of a determination
on the part of an institution to
get men of a certain type for its faculty,
and to provide them with facilities for doing
the broadest and biggest work possible.
I may be mistaken, but I am inclined
to think such an institution could find
more money as it needed more. And the
librarian skillful in discovering ways and
means would not be contented with his
yearly appropriations, but would succeed
in interesting trustees and friends of the
college to a point where interest would be
translated into deeds.</p>

<p>Now there is, of course, another side to
all this, and we should be short-sighted
indeed not to recognize it. The college
library which spent any considerable share
of its funds for research material which
really belongs only in the university library
would have no means whatever of
justifying itself&mdash;would be worse off than
an institution which had no research material
whatever. How may we guard
against this danger? I must take it for
granted that the sort of teacher I have
been considering would choose his research
material wisely and with the right
perspective. In case he failed to do this
I should expect the librarian to tell him
so. And back of the librarian should be
a real library committee; so constituted
as to represent the different departments
as fairly as possible; having charge of
the allotment of book funds; advising and
helping the librarian in the shaping of
the library's policy; the court of last resort
when an expensive and somewhat
doubtful set was being considered&mdash;I can
conceive of such a committee as being one
of the greatest factors in the success of
this whole undertaking. Let at least two
types of teachers be selected for it. The
one a man whose chief interest centers
in the personal and human side of his
students; who puts them first to the extent
that his work is with them rather than
with books or scholarly endeavor. The
other the man I have defined as the synthetic
research worker, broad in his sympathies
toward his students, but a man
who realizes both the need of the age for
culture, and his own ability to contribute
to it something worth while. By a fusion
of such types as these the rights of all
would be conserved&mdash;the needs of all met
so far as possible.</p>

<p>Just a word more by way of summary
and I shall be through.</p>

<p>I believe the book collection of the average
college library is much below what it
might be in point of quality. A possible
way of changing this situation for the
better is to encourage members of the
faculty to do research work. This would
also result in a higher standard of teaching&mdash;or
so at least all the teachers with
whom I have talked assure me. It is not
necessary to assume that research is essential
to scholarship, but merely that it
adds something to a man's efficiency and
power that can be gotten in no other way.
The college librarian, if he cares to, can
play an important part in bringing these
things about.</p>

<p>You will doubtless find this scheme&mdash;represented
here only in outline&mdash;rather
idealistic, but so, I take it, are all educational
schemes. I can only hope that
you will find also some soundness in its
theory&mdash;some small addition to the constructive
criticism of a condition which I
believe to be fundamentally wrong.</p>

<p>Miss MINNIE E. SEARS, head cataloger
of the University of Minnesota library,
presented a paper on</p>


<h3>CATALOGING FOR DEPARTMENT
LIBRARIES</h3>

<p>Before beginning the discussion of cataloging
for department libraries, let me
say that as it is a subject which is still
in the experimental stage and not yet capable
of generalization, the statements
made in this paper are based, partly upon
information collected from certain university
libraries in which this problem is now
being worked out, and partly on my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
experience in organizing the department
catalogs of the University of Minnesota.
The other libraries quoted are those of
the University of Chicago, Columbia, Illinois,
Johns Hopkins, Michigan, Missouri
and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>In considering the problem of cataloging
for department libraries, we may start
with a definition and an assumption. For
the purpose of this discussion it may be
said that a department library is not a
mere handful of reference books on a subject,
but a more or less comprehensive collection
of books on the subject shelved
and used separately from the collections of
the main library; and it may be assumed
that the necessity for a separate catalog
of such a collection is admitted by all.</p>

<p>Assuming this, the first question that
presents itself is that of the form of the
department catalog. Shall it be an author,
a classed or a dictionary catalog, or, since
in most cases the department library is
a small open-shelf collection, will it suffice
to have a shelf-list only, serving also
as a classed catalog? The shelf-list would
offer the simplest and cheapest solution
of the difficulty, but the day when it was
accepted as a solution of the entire problem
has passed. Not one of the libraries
consulted suggests the shelf-list alone as
a possible arrangement. An author catalog,
at least, is needed in addition, and the
majority of these libraries report dictionary
catalogs in some of the department libraries,
if not in all. Chicago University
is to provide for the department libraries
outside of Harper building an author catalog
and a shelf-list, where printed cards
are available, and an author catalog only
for the department libraries within Harper
building. Columbia, Michigan, Illinois
and Minnesota have dictionary catalogs
for all department libraries. Missouri has
dictionary catalogs in 3, and Wisconsin in
2 department libraries, while Johns Hopkins
is to have dictionary catalogs in all
department libraries which are outside its
main building.</p>

<p>A more difficult question is that of the
scope of the catalog. How exhaustive is
it possible, or even desirable, to make it?
It must, of course, include all books in the
department library itself, but shall it also
record all books dealing with the same
subject to be found elsewhere in the university?
Such completeness of record
would be the ideal arrangement, and
would, undoubtedly, meet with the hearty
approval of the university departments.
But will not the cost be prohibitive to
many libraries, even in this day of printed
cards and multigraph? To be of value,
such elaborate cataloging should be
done thoroughly and systematically and
above all, once undertaken, should never
be allowed to lapse, or confusion will be
the result. The fuller information about
related materials in other parts of the library
can always be obtained from the
main library catalog, if that record is a
union catalog of department libraries as
well; and if the department librarian is
in telephone communication with the reference
librarian at the main library, the information
can be obtained almost as quickly
as if it were included in the department
catalog. We may, therefore, conclude that
the department catalog complete for its
own library but not including related material
in other libraries, is the most practicable
form under present conditions, although
the ideal form is the more complete
catalog which expense at present
generally prohibits.</p>

<p>The third point which our problem raises
is that of variations in cataloging from
the rules followed in the general library
catalog. The first important variation
which suggests itself as possible is in the
treatment of analytics. Shall analytics be
included in the department catalog, and
if so, shall they be the same as those in
the general catalog? On this point the
practice of our eight libraries varies somewhat.
Chicago University is not planning
to include any analytics in its department
catalogs, and Johns Hopkins includes only
a few. Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota,
in the main, duplicate for their department
catalogs the analytics made for their main
catalogs and, as a rule, include no addi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>tional
analytics. The Columbia practice
is more ambitious, as that library includes
in its department catalog analytics (mainly
articles in periodicals) which are not
included in its general catalog. An article
in the <b>Columbia University Quarterly</b>
for March, 1911, states that the department
catalogs have analytics for all important
serials that bear upon the work
of the departments whether shelved there
or in the general library, that is, the department
library catalog attempts to serve
both as catalog and index. These cards
are intended for temporary use only, to
be removed when the demand for them
ceases.</p>

<p>In most university libraries it would be
impossible to keep up systematically such
elaborate catalogs, and it is not clear that
such indexing&mdash;for it is indexing rather
than cataloging&mdash;would be desirable in all
places. A catalog can never be made to
take the place of a reference librarian, or
of an intelligent use of the important annual
and other subject indexes to the literature
of a subject, such as <b>Psychological
Index</b>, the various <b>Jahresberichte</b>, etc.
Moreover, every reference or department
librarian naturally does more or less in the
way of keeping up card indexes or bibliographies,
which are frequently revised
and the old material discarded as new
and better material takes its place. Such
reference indexes are simpler and more
practical than serial analytics in a department
catalog, since they do not call for
expert revision and absolute uniformity of
subject headings. On the whole, the tendency
of present opinion and practice
seems to be that important analytics which
are useful in the general catalog are useful
in the department catalog also, but that
beyond that it is better to encourage the
use of the printed indexes and the keeping
of an informal reference index for material
not yet included in the printed aids.</p>

<p>A more important possibility of variation,
where the department catalog is dictionary
in form, is found in subject headings.
Will the same headings that are
found satisfactory in the main library
catalog serve equally well in the department
catalog as used by specialists? Too
much emphasis can not be laid upon the
fact that any variation of this kind greatly
increases the cost of the cataloging, as
the assigning and revision of two sets of
subject headings, one for the general and
one for the department catalog, will mean
that that part of the work is greatly increased,
though not doubled. The correct
assignment of subject headings presents
enough difficulties under any circumstances,
and the catalog supervisor should
hesitate to multiply these unless there is
strong reason for doing so. In libraries
which have adopted the Library of Congress
subject headings, those headings,
with minor variations, will, for most subjects,
be found satisfactory in the department
as well as in the general catalog. Law
will at once occur to all as a subject for
which it may be desirable to run two sets
of headings. We have done this at the
University of Minnesota, using the special
Library of Congress law headings in
the department catalog, and the regular
Library of Congress headings in the general
catalog. A point to be carefully considered
in adopting more than one set of
subject headings, moreover, is the possible
confusion of mind that may be produced
in the student, the exigencies of whose
work require him to use more than one of
the library catalogs. Such records are
certainly much easier to use when there
is uniformity of subject entries, and the
adoption of several different sets of subject
headings will certainly cause confusion,
even to members of the library staff,
much more to students.</p>

<p>After the questions of form, scope, and
contents of the department catalog, comes
the practical question of how best to get
the work done. It can be done in either of
two ways, by the regular cataloging force
of the university or by the department librarians.
In most university libraries the
cataloging staff is small in comparison
with the amount always to be done, and
the work of keeping the general catalog
up to date taxes all its powers, and leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
no time for extra records such as department
catalogs. On the other hand,
does not the department librarian have
more or less time which, when properly
arranged, could be given to cataloging under
the direction of the head cataloger?
We have found this to be the case at the
University of Minnesota. Until three years
ago our department libraries were all under
the supervision of the various departments,
and hence in a more or less chaotic
state. Some of these have not yet
emerged from chaos. In these three years,
however, we have evolved a system by
which this work is done by the department
librarians, or, in one case, by an assistant
in the department library. It has so far
proved a perfectly workable system for
our given conditions. All the department
librarians so far appointed have been either
library school graduates or people with
equivalent library training, and in addition
to that, in some cases, with special knowledge
of the subjects of the departments.
One of the first duties of the department
librarian, on taking charge of his library,
has been to organize it, classifying and
cataloging it under the supervision of the
head of the catalog department, but doing
the work in the department library. The
question has been raised as to how the department
librarian could do the reference
work and other work of his library, and at
the same time catalog the department
books for both the department and general
catalog. Of course the cataloging will
be intermittent and more or less interrupted,
as our rule is that the work for
the public must be done first. Until, however,
the books of a department library
are in order and properly listed, no satisfactory
reference work can be done with
them. Our own experience has certainly
been that the reference work of our department
librarians has been strengthened
by their work of cataloging. The general
library gains also from this work of the
department librarian, as the latter does
the cataloging of his books for the general
catalog at the same time as that for the
department catalog, and so the growth of
the general library catalog is greatly promoted,
without a corresponding tax upon
the resources of the catalog department. In
as far as possible the work is revised by
the head cataloger or a reviser, in the department
library, but in some cases of
difficult revision it has been found necessary
to transfer the books to the catalog
department for revision there. At present,
whenever printed cards can not be
obtained, all cards are actually made by
the department librarian, but as soon as
we are able to adopt the multigraph, rough
copy only will be supplied by that assistant.</p>

<p>After the department library has been
thoroughly organized and cataloged, the
department librarian goes on with the
lighter task of cataloging the current
accessions of his library for both the department
and the general catalog.</p>

<p>Some of the advantages of thus having
the work done by the trained department
librarians are:</p>

<p>1. It adds several workers to the cataloging
force of the library, and thus makes
it possible to do much more in the way
of providing needed departmental catalogs.
This fact has been of great importance
with us at the University of Minnesota,
where, with the present cataloging force
alone, it would have been impossible to
provide these catalogs. Besides, there is
the advantage to the general library of
getting the cataloging of these same books
done for the general catalog.</p>

<p>2. The department librarian should
have, and generally does have, special
knowledge of his subject, which is of assistance
in cataloging, especially in classification
and the assignment of subject
headings.</p>

<p>3. As the work is done in the department
it is easy for the department librarian
to consult the professors whenever
necessary or desirable.</p>

<p>4. There is a real advantage to the department
librarian in the added familiarity
with the department books which he has
gained in cataloging them. This is particularly
true in the case of the librarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
who, in the beginning, is not a specialist
in his subject, but even the specialist may
gain some knowledge from this handling
of the material which will help him in
the service of his readers. Moreover, if
he has actually made the catalog, he can
use it more intelligently himself and instruct
his students better in the use of it.</p>

<p>Our scheme has certain disadvantages
as well as advantages. Some of these are:</p>

<p>1. There is danger that not enough cataloging
research work will be done when
the cataloging is done in the department
library, because many of the important
catalog and bibliographical aids are not
accessible outside the catalog department&mdash;for
example, the depository or union
catalog of printed cards.</p>

<p>2. There is danger that the existing records
will not be consulted enough, because
the general catalog is not easily accessible
and can only be consulted on special
trips to the main library.</p>

<p>3. When the work is thus decentralized,
there is much greater difficulty in
obtaining from the various assistants work
which is even fairly uniform. No one
who has had experience in trying to manage
such work will minimize this difficulty.
For this reason, the revision is
more difficult, and must be done with the
greatest care, especially in the matter of
subject headings.</p>

<p>4. It is sometimes more difficult to get
good cataloging from those whose first
interest does not lie in this branch of the
work, and who are not closely associated
with the regular catalogers, and familiar
with the many traditions of a catalog department.
For this reason we have found
at Minnesota, that it is an advantage to
have a newly appointed department librarian
work in the catalog department for a
time before taking up the work in his library.</p>

<p>We have found, however, that with us
the advantages outweigh the disadvantages,
particularly the one great advantage
that it has been a practical way of
accomplishing work which could not have
been done by our present cataloging department.</p>


<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>A tabulated summary of the replies
received from the libraries circularized has
been prepared, but as it is too detailed for
reading here, I will omit it, and present,
instead, a few conclusions which may fairly
be drawn from this summary. While
practice is not uniform on any one point
of department cataloging, certain tendencies
toward uniformity are clearly evident.</p>

<p>1. In the matter of department librarians
there is clearly a tendency towards
the appointment of trained workers having,
whenever possible, some special
knowledge of the subject of their departments
as well. This, of course, is important,
if the cataloging is to be done
in the department libraries. All these libraries
feel, also, the need for some kind
of department catalogs, although the number
of such catalogs already established
varies from three at the University of
Wisconsin to twenty-three at Columbia.</p>

<p>2. There is a pretty general agreement
that the dictionary catalog is the most desirable
for department libraries. Columbia,
Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota report
dictionary catalogs in all organized department
libraries, and Johns Hopkins in all department
libraries outside the main building.
Wisconsin and Missouri report dictionary
catalogs in certain department libraries,
and Chicago reports author catalogs
and shelf-lists. All the libraries using
dictionary catalogs report the use, in the
main, of the same kind of subject headings
in department as in general catalogs,
except for certain special subjects, such as
law, or for certain highly specialized collections,
such as the Avery Architectural
library at Columbia.</p>

<p>3. There is a somewhat greater variation
in the scope of material to be included.
So far, only two libraries, Columbia and
Michigan, report any department catalogs
covering more than the material in the
department libraries, but Missouri and Minnesota
report that they intend, eventually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
to have their department catalogs include
all books on the subject in the university.
In the matter of analytics the majority
practice is to include the same analytics in
both general and department catalogs, although
Chicago uses no analytics at all in
department catalogs, while Columbia, at
the other extreme, includes more analytics
in department catalogs than in the general
catalog.</p>

<p>4. Present opinion seems to be pretty
evenly divided on the subject of whether
the actual work of cataloging should be
done by the department librarians or by
the regular cataloging force, although
there is perhaps a tendency to have this
work done by the department librarians
wherever there are trained workers in
charge of the department libraries. Universities
in which the work for department
catalogs is done by the department librarians,
report that the department librarians
catalog these same books for the general
catalog as well.</p>

<p>In conclusion, let me repeat that if the
cataloging is done by the department librarians,
too much emphasis can not be
laid upon the fact that it is absolutely
essential to have all this work done under
the supervision of the head cataloger,
with the most careful revision. Otherwise
there will be as many varieties of cataloging
as there are department librarians.</p>

<p>In behalf of Dr. W. Dawson Johnston, of
Columbia, Miss Isadore G. Mudge read the
following</p>


<h3>PROPOSAL FOR A CATALOG OF UNIVERSITY
SERIAL PUBLICATIONS</h3>

<p>One of the desiderata of our exchange
departments, as well as of our reference
departments, is a catalog of American university
serial publications. This should
give in addition to the general title, a full
table of contents, and an index of the same.
It may be prepared by one library, or cooperatively
by the library of each institution
issuing such series, and published by
a central institution, as the bibliography
of American historical societies was published
by the Smithsonian Institution, or
published as the trade list annual is, each
institution printing its own catalog and
forwarding it to a publisher to be indexed,
bound with the catalogs of publications of
other institutions, and so published.</p>

<p>The desirability of such a catalog as a
record of American university publications
was presented to the Executive Committee
of the Association of American Universities
at its last meeting. The Committee
voted to recommend to the Association the
passage of the following resolution:</p>

<p>"Resolved, That the Association of American
Universities recommends to each of
its constituent universities the preparation
of a catalog of its serial publications and
the printing of the catalog in a form which
will permit the publication of the several
catalogs as a collected work, so arranged
and indexed as to make it a useful work
of reference."</p>

<p>If the members of the College Section
are similarly interested in such a catalog,
similar action on the part of the section
may be desirable. I present this suggestion
with some diffidence because although
the catalog will save librarians much labor
in the long run the preparation of it
would involve a large amount of extra labor
in the immediate future. In spite of
this, however, I hope that it will receive
your favorable consideration.</p>

<p>After some discussion it was voted that
the proposal be referred to the executive
committee of the College and Reference
Section for consideration.</p>

<p>The meeting then adjourned.</p>


<h3>REFERENCE LIBRARIANS'
ROUND TABLE</h3>

<p>The meeting of the Public Library Division
of the College and Reference Section
was held on the evening of June 27. It
was called to order by Edwin H. Anderson,
who turned it over to Miss Sarah B. Askew
of the New Jersey public library commission,
who acted as chairman for the evening.
The first speaker was Miss MARILLA
WAITE FREEMAN, librarian of
the Goodwyn Institute library of Memphis,
who spoke on</p>

<h3>SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT, AND THE
REFERENCE DEPARTMENT AS A
BUREAU OF INFORMATION</h3>

<p>What we call "reference work" has been
a little in disrepute of late, and there has
been some discussion as to the amount
of time which may legitimately be spent
in helping the curious inquirer to learn
how many of the Louis's died a natural
death, or whether Helen of Troy wore
locks of Titian red. But it is only in the
large library that there can be any limitation
of what we call the reference department
to the handling of such academic
quibbles. It is true that in the large library
the technical department, the business
branch, the art department may
limit and thin the quality of work left to
the reference librarian, till she (or he) may
feel that only the dry bones of the day's
research are hers (or his). But in the
small library there is no such limitation,
and the reference librarian, who may also
be the head librarian and the chief cataloger,
may come in touch each day with
every sort of human interest, from the
eager desire of the office clerk to get back
to the soil by the road of raising rice in
Arkansas or apples in Idaho, to the yearning
for economic independence and artistic
expression in the soul of the girl who
comes to pore over books on design.</p>

<p>To one who is fully awake to the human
side of things, there can never be any
dull monotony in the life of the reference
librarian. I have often wished I had time&mdash;and
genius&mdash;to write the Romance of a
Reference Library. It would cover as many
pages, and be almost as thrilling as the
Thousand-and-One-Nights. I wish I had
time to tell you, the Molly-Make-Believe
Episode of Goodwyn Institute library, or
the Tale of the Telegram from the Nicaragua
Revolution.</p>

<p>Now in the small library where one reference
assistant must be so many things
to so many people in the course of one day,
there is special need of scientific management
of time, labor, methods, resources.
Fortunately, the reference assistant has
few <b>statistics</b> to trouble with. The only
record that seems essential is that
of questions asked and topics looked up.
A pad of paper, dated, kept at one's elbow,
and questions jotted down almost as they
are being asked&mdash;this gives an interesting
basis for monthly and yearly reports, and
makes something to show for the day's
work much more interesting than mere figures,
and does furnish certain figures, especially
if we add, after each topic, approximate
number of books, pamphlets and
magazines used in getting information or
material desired.</p>

<p>From these daily sheets interesting deductions
can be made, classifications of different
kinds and sources of questions
asked, what classes of people are users
and which are non-users of the library,
on what lines the library needs to build
up its resources, in what directions it
needs to advertise better. Red pencil
checks may be placed against more significant
topics, for quick summarization at
the end of the month. If the question
is for school or club work, or likely to
recur again, take a pencil and small pad,
write Panama canal tolls or labor laws affecting
women, or whatever the subject
may be, at the top of the pad, and make
rapid note of magazine articles, books, etc.,
looked up. Much time is lost in looking
up the same things over and over again,
sometimes by one assistant, and sometimes
by another. Lists jotted roughly
down while material is being looked up,
or directly after, may be copied by typewriter
on catalog cards and filed alphabetically
in a special tray of the catalog
case, where they will be quickly available
for the next call. For debates, the material
listed on cards should be grouped
roughly under "general," "affirmative" and
"negative." It saves time, also, in collecting
books on the reserve shelf for a debate,
to mark the places by clipping to
the page a slip labelled "affirmative" or
"negative." Of course, for debate work
the first aid to scientific management is
the use, so far as possible, of the work
done by others in such invaluable little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
manuals as the Debaters' Hand-Book
series, and the debate pamphlets of the
Universities of Wisconsin, Texas, Iowa and
others, supplemented by the latest magazine
articles in the Readers' Guide.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> A brief list, entitled "Debaters' Aids," was
distributed in connection with this paper.</p></div>

<p>The same economic principle applies, of
course, to every other class of subjects
looked up. Make use of work done by
others, whether in the form of bibliographies,
indexes, reports and publications
of special organizations, or what not. Two
small indexes which save much time in
the small library are the Pittsburgh Library
Debate Index and their Contemporary
Biography. Though the latter is now
ten years old it is still extremely useful
to those libraries which are so fortunate as
to own copies.</p>

<p>Another economy of time and money is
the using of book-lists printed by other libraries
or organizations, checking on them
the titles in one's own library, putting the
library stamp upon them, and distributing
them to the class of users interested. Goodwyn
Institute library has recently done this
with the booklet entitled: "What to read
on business efficiency," issued by the Business
Book Bureau of New York.</p>

<p>An important psychological point is
always to get one good piece of material
before each <b>researcher</b> promptly, then
other material may be gathered more deliberately.
If several people are waiting
at once, give each one reference to start
on rather than serve one in detail while
all others wait their turn. Perhaps this
is a small and obvious trifle to dwell upon,
but it is a bromidium that trifles make success,
in reference work as in anything else.</p>

<p>Returning to the wisdom of using others'
work, I must emphasize the importance of
collecting the material put out by all sorts
of special organizations. We know that
every subject now has its literature, from
"votes for women" to the extermination
of the house fly or the loan shark. And
much of this matter, often in pamphlet or
leaflet form, is obtainable free or at small</p>

<p>cost. Frequently such literature is the latest
and most authoritative word upon any
subject.</p>

<p>In our scheme of scientific management,
therefore, the small library, perhaps even
more than the large, can not afford to do
without collecting such literature. The
pamphlet collection is indispensable. It
means work, but in the end by its live
usefulness it saves time. By scientific
management and intensive use a small library
with a good pamphlet collection can
get better results than one three times as
large whose resources are not up-to-date
and thoroughly made use of.</p>

<p>First, a word as to the filing of such
material; second, as to sources for securing
it. I cannot attempt to offer any new
solution to the vexed problem of pamphlet
disposal. I will merely state briefly how
Goodwyn Institute library handles its pamphlets.
We have found the system of filing
in pamphlet boxes most convenient and
practicable. A box is lettered with D. C.
number or inclusive numbers, and with
subject or subjects included, as 334.6 Agricultural
credit. Pamphlets are counted
as received, but not accessioned. If important,
catalog card is made under subject,
or author, rarely under both. If of
slight or only temporary value, they are
merely marked with class number, and
placed in box without cataloging. Sometimes
merely a general catalog card is
made to show that the library receives all
the publications of an organization, as with
the National American Woman Suffrage
Association, or with the American National
Child Labor Committee. In these cases
there would be both author and subject
card. Any specially important publication
of the association would be brought out by
separate card. A check on the pamphlet
would indicate whether or not it had been
cataloged.</p>

<p>For the small library which has not time
to catalog individual pamphlets, it would
be sufficient to make one general card for
each group, giving class number and subject
heading, as: "325 Immigration; for
material (or for additional material) on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
this subject, see pamphlet collection," or
merely, "See also pamphlets."</p>

<p>Goodwyn Institute clips also the local
newspapers and a few others for matters
of local or special interest, mounts the
more valuable clippings on manila sheets,
8x10 in size, numbers them, occasionally
catalogs an important one, and files them
with pamphlets on the same subjects. To
keep the collection from becoming obsolete,
or occupying too much space, it
should be gone over once a year, and old
pamphlets and clippings and their cards
withdrawn and destroyed. With many constantly
changing subjects in agriculture,
engineering, current problems, etc., it becomes
instinctive with the reference assistant
to bring forth first to the would-be
investigator the pamphlet box or boxes on
that subject, then the more recent magazine
articles, and only last the books.</p>

<p>In Goodwyn Institute library the pamphlet
collection is supplemented by a vertical
file, arranged alphabetically under
the same headings as the pamphlets. In
this file are placed letters, circulars, typewritten
lists, and the like, not advisable to
be placed in the pamphlet boxes. A practical
plan for indexing this material is a general
card on each subject included, to be
filed at end of regular cards in cataloging:
e. g. "Levees; for additional material, see
vertical file." For the very small library
the vertical file is perhaps the most convenient
arrangement for disposing of pamphlets
and <b>all</b> unbound material in one
place.</p>

<p>Some of the larger libraries bind in inexpensive
form all pamphlets which are
considered worthy of preservation, but for
the small library this seems necessary only
in the case of pamphlets of unusual value
or size.</p>

<p>Now as to some of the sources of the
pamphlet and ephemeral literature which
is so valuable. I can not do better than
to remind you again of two lists with
which you are probably already familiar.
The first is "Social questions of today, selected
sources of information, compiled by
the Free Public Library, Newark, N. J.,"
1911. It may be obtained from the Editor
of Special Libraries, State Library, Indianapolis,
for ten cents. It includes the names
and addresses of organizations interested
in social questions, such as the American
Civic Association, the Russell Sage Foundation,
the Vocation Bureau of Boston, and
an index of subjects covered by the publications
of these organizations, such as
the cost of living, prison reform, sex hygiene,
vacation schools.</p>

<p>The second list is entitled "The library
and social movements; a list of material
obtainable free or at small expense." It
may be had from the A. L. A. Publishing
Board for five cents. This list includes material
on all sorts of sociological questions,
from co-operative stores to workingmen's
compensation. From these two lists a good
working collection of up-to-date, inexpensive
pamphlet material on social problems
may be obtained. Among recent organizations,
born since these lists were published
in 1911, are the Drama League of America,
the American Commission on Agricultural
Co-operation, the Southern Sociological
Congress. All these put out valuable and
inexpensive reports and publications. It
would be a boon to small, and even large
libraries, if the A. L. A. Publishing Board
would father a new list including and enlarging
the material of the two 1911 lists,
and adding the most important new organizations
and publications which have
since come into being.</p>

<p>The recently published index to Special
Libraries, Vol. 1-3, makes available, in that
indispensable little journal much valuable
material on current questions, and sources
of information.</p>

<p>For all subjects, technical, scientific, historical,
sociological, covered by the U. S.
Government publications, and these subjects
are innumerable, a convenient guide
to selection is offered by the brief classified
price-lists furnished by the Superintendent
of Documents. The suggestions in
the little weekly Government Publications,
published by M. E. Greathouse at 510 12th
St., N. W., Washington, at fifty cents a
year, are also helpful, as are the notes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
the A. L. A. Booklist, which now lists
many government documents. The "Interesting
Things in Print" column in Public
Libraries should be carefully scanned, as
should the "Periodical and other literature"
department of the Library Journal.</p>

<p>To get upon the regular mailing list
of as many organizations as possible
saves much time spent in writing for individual
publications. And even where there
is a membership fee, as of $2.00 per year
to the Drama League of America, for example,
it will bring far more valuable returns
in twelve months than the same
amount expended in books.</p>

<p>The first labor of writing for and handling
a collection of pamphlet literature
seems considerable, but when properly organized
its daily up-keep is not difficult
and its presence in a library goes far to
make possible the scientific management
of the queries and problems which come
each day to the reference desk.</p>

<p>May I rather say the information desk.
We librarians are so at home with our
own terminology, have talked so long and
familiarly of reference desks, reference
work, the reference library, that I doubt
if we ever realize the foreignness of our
language to the shy visitor within our
gates. "Ask in the reference room" means
worse than nothing to him, but the simple
legend "Information desk" will draw him
like the kindly and familiar face of a
friend.</p>

<p>The idea that a modern library is, or
should be, a central Bureau of Information
for its town or city is one that we first
have to get thoroughly into our own heads,
and then impress upon our public. In the
effort to find the simplest and most effective
way to present this idea to our Memphis
public, we tried running the following
card in the street cars:</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>What do <b>You</b> want to Know?</p>

<p>You have 12,000 Books, Trade Journals,
Magazines on all subjects, and an
Information Bureau for <b>Your</b> use absolutely
<b>Free</b> in Goodwyn Institute
Library.</p></div>

<p>We were able to make specially advantageous
terms with the street car advertising
company, whose representative had
himself made use of the resources of the
library, and we have been running this
card, or similarly worded ones, for over a
year. The results, sometimes direct, sometimes
indirect, have been very interesting.
The card has brought us many business
men, and other street car users, who,
seeing our invitation daily, recall it from
the depths of their subconsciousness when
they do want to know. The card is often
taken quite literally, as in the case of
the young Russian from Odessa, later from
St. Louis, who read the sign in the street
car which brought him from the railway
station. He came straight to the library
and to the information desk, told his story
briefly and succinctly, and asked how he
could find a position as house boy, for
which he was qualified. The Jewish Rabbi
happened to be in the library at the moment.
He called up the head of the Jewish
Charities, who on hearing that the lad was
from Odessa, said: "Why, that is my native
place! Send him along and I will surely
find him something." And he did.</p>

<p>Another bright-eyed youth, who worked
with a moving-picture corporation in the
daytime, but had his evenings free, came
in to ask if we had d'Espuy's "Architecture
antique." He was overjoyed when he saw
it and other folios on the subject, said
he was wanting to go on with the study
of architecture at night, and had seen our
street car card. "That card's a fine stunt,"
he added. Then there was the case of the
two young men who had come down the
river by boat from Iowa, looking for work
as extra Christmas clerks. They were sent
up to us by a policeman, from whom they
asked information. We sent them to the
Y. M. C. A. Department of Employment,
and one of them afterward came back to
tell us they had both gotten a job. We
do not at all mind being teased a bit about
our "Employment Bureau," so glad are we
that the policeman and the man-on-the-street
should instantly think of Goodwyn
Institute library when asked for any in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>formation
which he cannot give. We desire
to be regarded as a sort of central
clearing house for general information,
even when the question is of so primitive
and vital a nature as how a man shall earn
his next meal, and to this end we take
as our motto "Nothing human is alien to
us."</p>

<p>We think it is within our legitimate
field to tell the man not that he has come
to the wrong place, but to tell him the
address of the right place, and sometimes
even to give him a note or do a moment's
telephoning that will connect him with the
right place, and will make him feel that
the library's "What do <b>you</b> want to know?"
means him.</p>

<p>The point I wish to emphasize is: Never
let a man go away without either the information
for which he has come, or the
knowledge as to where he may find it.
This does not mean that we must spend
precious time in looking up irrelevant questions,
or in attempting to handle matters
which some other library or organization
could deal with more efficiently. It does
mean that it is our business as a Bureau
of Information to know just where that
question can be most effectively handled,
and then to direct the inquirer there.</p>

<p>Thus if a man desires a certain address
in Los Angeles, we send him to the Cotton
Exchange, one block away, which has a
full line of directories, open to the public;
if a certain government monograph which
we do not possess, we refer him to the
Cossitt library, which as a government depository
has a full collection of public documents;
if other than a very simple legal
reference, we refer him to the law library,
mentioning its hours and restrictions.</p>

<p>If the information desired may be secured
by letter, we often give a reader the
necessary address and let him write himself.
We ought, of course, to save the library's
time in this way whenever possible.
Yet frequently the information or material
to be secured would have a future value
to the library itself, or to the city, and
whenever this is the case, this advantage,
together with the reader's grateful appreciation
of the library for getting him what
he wants when he wants it, surely justifies
us in writing the letter ourselves. Thus,
Goodwyn Institute library has recently secured
much information and literature on
smoke abatement experience of other cities,
for engineers suddenly forced to apply
modern methods by a stringent city ordinance.
Assistance has been given in the
same way to the Mississippi Valley Levee
Association; to a committee appointed to
present a county insanity commission bill
to the state legislature; to the city engineer,
on the practice of different cities
as to grade-crossings and railroad track
elevation; again to an individual reader
who wished to learn what diseases are
native to South Carolina in distinction
from those supposed to be cured by residence
there; to a local manufacturer on
the process of making paper from cotton
stalks; to a student on the death rate and
prevalence of tuberculosis among negroes;
to another on the best methods of alfalfa
raising in West Tennessee.</p>

<p>The use of the telephone is encouraged
for information needed quickly. If a busy
business man wishes to know the name
and address of the U. S. Consul in Peru,
the 1910 population of Guthrie, Oklahoma,
the meaning of a troublesome phrase in a
Spanish letter, he appreciates knowing
that he can get a prompt reply by calling
up the library. The St. Joseph library
makes this feature of its information service
effectively known by attractive blotters
and leaflets sent to business men.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with the insistent
demands of club members and of school
children, set sometimes, the former by
the club system, and the latter by the
school system, to subjects beyond their
grasp. Of the vexed problem of distributing
our crowded hours judiciously among
all these demands, Miss Bacon has written
most lucidly in her delightful paper on
"What the public wants," in the May (1913)
Library Journal.</p>

<p>Certainly we do have to learn to discriminate
as to the time and attention we give
to each demand upon us. Yet each is im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>portant
to the man, woman or child, who
makes it, and however briefly and expeditiously
we may dispose of it, let us make
the questioner feel that he did well to
come to us, that we are for the moment
concentrating upon his problem, and that
we are giving him the best assistance in
our power, even if it be only an address,
or a telephone number, or the name of
the book in which his question will be
answered.</p>

<p>Let me repeat that it is all largely a
matter of making our library a clearing
house of information, of connecting the
man with the answer to his question,
rather than of necessarily answering it
ourselves. And to this end, and by these
means, may the small library be as useful
as the large.</p>

<p>The next speaker was Miss SARAH B.
BALL, librarian of the business branch
of the Newark free public library, who
spoke on</p>


<h3>WHAT ANY LIBRARY CAN DO FOR
THE BUSINESS INTERESTS OF
THE TOWN</h3>

<p>Have you ever felt discouraged over the
purely potential value of your reference
books, because they seem to remain forever
potential? Have you ever turned the
pages of the World Almanac and sighed
over perfectly good answers which you
could give to questions that nobody asks
you? Every reference librarian present
knows what I mean. When is wheat harvested
in Burmah? Who is the secretary
of sanitation in Cuba? How long does
it take a letter to go from New York to
Melbourne, via Vancouver? Are grapes
more nutritious than plums? What are the
dues in the Knickerbocker Club? What
three nations have dominions on which the
sun never sets? How many shipwrecks
last year on the U. S. coasts?</p>

<p>These questions are being asked by somebody
and being answered in a fashion by
somebody. Very often that "somebody"
is the editor of the query column in the
newspaper. The newspapers of the country
have educated the people to turn to
them with their questions. How many of
those questions could be answered just as
well or better by the public library? How
often the newspaper itself turns to the
public library for the answers? Here is
truly an unnecessary duplication of work
and a loss of time. Here is also a high-road
to popularity and an opportunity for usefulness
to a community clearly seen by
newspapers and worth cultivating by public
libraries.</p>

<p>While we are making laws, librarians
might conspire to put through a city ordinance
to compel all questioning people
to call on the public library as the <b>first</b>
source of information. As that is manifestly
impossible, something must be done
to attract the business and trade interests
of a town to the public library as a bureau
of information. Why? Because the citizens
pay taxes to support an institution&mdash;the
public library&mdash;that they may be, by
that institution, helped to become not simply
better, but also wiser; not simply wiser,
but also better informed; not simply better
informed in general, but also better informed
in city affairs; not simply in city
affairs, but also in the affairs of each industrial
unit. In a word, the city supports
a library that the library may help it to
become more harmonious, better governed
and more productive.</p>

<p>As the institution is supported for specific
purposes, it should not only be prepared
to fulfill these purposes; it should also
let it be known to all that it is thus prepared.</p>

<p>It should let those who support it know
that it can not only help one who seeks
general culture; but can also help one who
seeks knowledge of city management in
any of its countless aspects, or knowledge
of methods of productive or distributive
processes in any of their countless forms.</p>

<p>Possibly the first thing to do in thus
letting its practical powers be known is to
introduce into its vocabulary the phrase
"business department" or "information department."
A wider range of questions
comes to a library that uses the words "information"
or "business department" in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>stead
of "reference department." The
words "public library" do not convey to
the mind of the average person a suggestion
of a tenth of the resources for information
that are locked up in the collections
of printed things which our cities
now maintain.</p>

<p>An inquiring Newarker once said to me
"Why should a public library advertise itself?
Surely everyone knows where it is
and that it contains books."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "but, do you yourself know
what those books contain? Would you go
to the library to learn the elevation above
sea level of the street corner on which
you live, or for the width of the street?
Would you go there to plan your next business
trip by using the maps of the cities
you will visit, so that time will not be lost
in going from one factory to another?
If you are trying to sell a patented ticket
punch, do you go to the library for the
names of purchasing agents of railroads?
If you have lost the address of a business
correspondent do you telephone to the library
or do you set the whole office force
on edge hunting for the lost letter? Would
you turn to the library for the date of
Wilson's Chicago address, or the launching
of a new battleship?"</p>

<p>He went away wiser; and left me quite
pleased with myself.</p>

<p>Many public libraries have undertaken
the task of collecting manufacturers' catalogs
from all parts of the United States.
Our experience indicates that this is a
heavy expense with comparatively slight
return. Would it not be better to spend
the same amount of time and money compiling
information about the industries of
one's own town? It is a hopeless task to
represent adequately the manufacturers of
the United States. It is not a hopeless
task to compile information about local
manufacturers that will prove of great value.
No business directory gives the specific
information that is a daily need
among the business men of a community.
The directory gives, for example, a list
of paper-box manufacturers, but does not
indicate those who make egg boxes, hat
boxes, jewelry boxes, etc. It lists the jewelry
manufacturers, but is useless if you
want the names of those who make 22-karat
wedding rings. Many manufacturers
and dealers are sending to distant cities,
through habit, for articles made equally
well and at the same cost within their own
city, for no other reason than that they
lack detailed information of the products
of their own city. In some places the
Board of Trade is the natural clearing
house for this information. This is as it
should be.</p>

<p>But what about the towns that are
without Boards of Trade or whose Boards
of Trade are not equipped to give this information?
It is safe to say that there are
not ten cities in the United States where
one can find on file for the use of the
public complete and specific information
about the industries of that city. To secure
this information is not an easy task.
It requires circular letters, follow-up letters
and possibly personal calls; but the
value of thus creating an interest in the
public library among those citizens who
are paying the heaviest taxes, coupled with
the real importance of the information itself,
makes it an undertaking of peculiar
value to a tax-supported public library.
Fortunately the smaller the city the fewer
the manufacturers and the easier the
task, so that here indeed is a piece of
work that may well be undertaken by libraries
of many towns and cities.</p>

<p>We have grown in Newark, from being
the conventional and rather academic library,
to one that has quite large sources
of civic and manufacturing and commercial
and financial information. The question
now is, how shall we get the people
to realize the change? We are somewhat
in the position of a dry goods store which
has transformed itself into a department
store, but is visited largely by those who
seek only dry goods. We need to advertise
our groceries, hardware, furniture and
china.</p>

<p>If library architecture would only permit
of show windows, as do all our Newark
branches, the task would be greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
simplified. What a show window has
meant to the business branch can be seen
any day. A passerby is first attracted by
the bright color of a map showing the
London subway system. He pauses to read
the old familiar words: "Trafalgar
Square," "Tottenham Court Road" and
"Ludgate Circus." Beside it is a new directory
of the clothing trade, or a book
on insurance, a pamphlet on civil service,
or a new trolley guide. Finally, his curiosity
aroused over the kind of a business
house that can have such diversified interests,
he looks up at the gold-lettered sign
on the window and reads with puzzled expression,
"Business Branch and Reading
Room of the Free Public Library." Often
he peers curiously in to see what kind of
people are inside, and, seeing a room full
of men, comes boldly in and asks for&mdash;a
directory of Spuyten Duyvil, or some
other obscure place. The window display
has broadened his idea of the resources of
the public library, which he had hitherto
thought of as having nothing to interest
him.</p>

<p>Where a library can afford it there are
many advantages in establishing a business
department. It keeps together closely
related subjects, it is very helpful to
business men, and it helps in advertising.
If a permanent business department is impossible,
there is much to be gained by a
temporary showing of all that can be
gathered relating to business.</p>

<p>All libraries have more of this material
than we perhaps realize, surely more than
the public realize. By bringing it together
and displaying well-printed signs concerning
it we are following sound advertising
principles. The man who sees a
sign in the library, "Our business is answering
questions," will not be so absurdly
apologetic over "bothering you" with his
wants, and will use the resources of the
library to better advantage than the man
who thinks it is only for lending books.</p>

<p>Other signs that may be used with good
effect are these:</p>

<p>"Have you an idea? Patent it. The library
will tell you how."</p>

<p>"You support this library. Do you use
it?"</p>

<p>"Why guess about things? Your Public
Library can give you the facts. Telephone
or write."</p>

<p>"A valuable export trade is yours if you
follow the consular reports in the Public
Library."</p>

<p>"Follow the work of the Legislature.
The bills are on file at the Public Library."</p>

<p>Framed signs of the library as Bureau
of Information, placed in public places,
are good permanent advertisements. Personal
visits to the places where questions
are being asked&mdash;the post office, the railroad,
telegraph, newspaper and express offices,
and the suggestion that those in
charge send to the public library all inquiries
they do not wish to be troubled
with or can not satisfy, will turn many people
toward the library.</p>

<p>If it is the item of expense that stands
in the way of business work in your library,
have you considered possible economies
in other lines? Why not discontinue
a certain fashion magazine and add a financial
one? Turn down an order for a history
of the court of Queen Anne and buy
a good history of Wall Street. Get along
without that valuable but expensive book
on the ancient civilization of the Egyptians
and buy a directory of the manufacturers
of the world. Deny your worthy scholars
the latest commentary on Plato and get
your business men the latest book on accountancy.
Sacrifice an historical or classical
atlas and secure the best maps of
your own locality. Decide against the
Portuguese dictionary and buy a cable
code. Cancel the order for so-and-so's travels
in British Guiana and subscribe for the
Official Railway Guide.</p>

<p>Here are suggestions for a few resources
to be used in meeting business inquiries of
a general order, such as come to a library
that advertises itself as a Bureau of Information,
and some things we have found
useful in business work:</p>

<p>1. The latest edition of the city directory,
directories of local towns, of the capitol
of the state, and of the largest cities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the United States. An exchange of directories
one year old with other public libraries
has proved quite satisfactory. It increases
your resources, and the fact that
you ask for year-old directories from local
business houses for the purpose of exchange
is a good advertisement of the library's
business side. The cost of sending
a 5-lb. directory to any part of the United
States by book-rate express is about fifty
cents.</p>

<p>If you cannot afford directories, get telephone
books from the American Telephone
and Telegraph Co., New York City, at
prices ranging from 35 to 50 cents. Many
of these contain classified sections. A
classified telephone directory of New York
may be obtained free by writing to Mr.
Reuben J. Donnelly, 37 Fulton Street, New
York City.</p>

<p>2. The very best local maps. To spend
$30 on a real estate atlas may seem extravagant;
but such atlases are usually
issued at intervals of 6 to 10 years, and
will prove one of the most useful sources
of local information.</p>

<p>3. The Official Railway Guide. If the library
cannot afford to pay $8.00 a year for
it, get a month-old copy from the local railway
office. It contains the most complete
list of U. S. towns in print and is of value
as a gazetteer and in many other ways.</p>

<p>4. The Western Union A. B. C. and Lieber
Cable Codes are the only general
codes in use. They cost about $32.00.</p>

<p>5. A table for displaying catalogs of
business book publishers. This will increase
the use of business books and lead
to many good recommendations by visitors.</p>

<p>6. A monthly magazine, "Business
News," of the Business Book Bureau of
New York. It indexes articles in the principal
business magazines and lists the important
new business books.</p>

<p>7. A typewriter for the free use of visitors.
The local office of a typewriter company
may place one in the library as an
advertisement.</p>

<p>8. Reports of transactions on the New
York stock exchange or of transactions in
local securities. Local brokers' offices will
consider it a good advertisement to place
these on file.</p>

<p>9. Trolley guides. Fifty cents spent on
these each year will fortify the library
against all attacks in that line.</p>

<p>10. Thomas's Register of American
Manufacturers, price $15.00. With this in
hand you can say that, "The Public Library
can give you names of pill-box manufacturers
in all parts of the U. S., the
name of the man who makes office furniture
in Marietta, Ohio, or the place where
Rubberset products are manufactured."</p>

<p>11. Kelly's Directory of Merchants,
Manufacturers and Shippers of the World.
Price 30s. This enables you to say, "The
Public Library can give you the name of
German manufacturers of mirrors, the
dealers in lacquered ware in Tokio, the
name of a bank in Warsaw, a forwarding
agent in Sydney or the express facilities of
Coburg."</p>

<p>With a simple and inexpensive equipment,
somewhat like that included in these
eleven items, backed by wide advertising
in the local press, a public library can attract
the business men of a town to use the
institution they support, an institution
which should be turned to by everyone
in the municipality as the very first source
of information.</p>

<p>Miss EDITH KAMMERLING, head of
the Civics Room of the Chicago public
library, presented most ably the work
which could be done by any library in the
civics line, under the title</p>


<h3>A CIVICS ROOM IN A MEDIUM-SIZED
TOWN</h3>

<p>Perhaps the best method of indicating
the scope and material of a civics room in
a medium-sized library is to describe what
are the essentials of a civics room in a
large city, permitting the adaptation of
such features of the latter to the former
as the locality and conditions may suggest.</p>

<p>A year ago last month a room was
opened in the Chicago public library which
is known as the civics room. The legend
on the door announces "Sociology, Municipal
Affairs, Business, Economics, Political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
Science, and Education." At first people
were very curious to see what the civics
room was like, and many there were of
the idle curious who came to see what we
had, but as the subjects dealt with were
not what are generally considered as
sources of amusement and entertainment,
this patronage gradually ceased until now
we have only the earnest, studious class.</p>

<p>The work required in assembling and
taking care of the material is such as to
demand the most concentrated efforts and
the most specialized training upon the part
of the librarian. She must be familiar
with the great issues of the day and must
be able to look ahead and assemble material
where she sees that a topic is engaging
the attention of public-spirited men.</p>

<p>The material which is stored in the civics
room, therefore, is less in the form of
books than in the way of pamphlets, magazine
articles, and newspaper clippings&mdash;that
which is usually regarded as ephemera.
The latest material is not to be found in
books, for by the time a subject has been
before the public, has been talked about,
assimilated, and finally published in book
form it is practically an old subject.</p>

<p>One of the first considerations for the librarian
is where to obtain this material.
Our civics room has a card index of institutions
and societies that are interested
in the subjects that we cover in our work,
and since we are on the mailing list of
most of the associations we are pretty well
supplied with their publications. The National
Municipal Review, published quarterly
by the National Municipal League, has
a section devoted to new pamphlet material
and is a great help in learning of new
publications. Other journals of particular
value are: The Survey, with its Information
Desk, The Municipal Engineer,
The American City, and The American Political
Science Review.</p>

<p>For magazine articles, of course we have
the Readers' Guide, but most of our magazine
material is in the form of separates.
The branches of our library return innumerable
magazines to the main library and
these are immediately dismembered and
the articles of value and interest to us are
taken out and treated as if they were
pamphlets. Our newspaper clippings are
obtained from 150 foreign and domestic
newspapers which our reading room receives
daily. Representative material is
obtained in this way from all sections of
the country. The pamphlets, magazine
separates, and newspaper clippings, together
with a small, well-selected collection
of books and a goodly supply of current
magazines upon economic and sociological
subjects constitute the material of the
room.</p>

<p>If you were to visit our civics room you
would see one entire side of the room lined
with pamphlet boxes. Each box represents
a subject. Collected in one box are pamphlets,
magazine separates, and newspaper
clippings. The patron is not compelled to
read antiquated books in studying his subject,
nor is he compelled to go through the
Readers' Guide and wait for his magazines
to be brought to him. Here, all gathered
together, is the latest material to be had.
Each pamphlet is classified; each magazine
separate is made into permanent form
by being stapled in a manila folder with
source, title, date, and class number on
the cover; each newspaper clipping is
classified with source and date and placed
in a large manila envelope. We use the
Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau's
expansion of the 300's of the Dewey Classification
for classifying our material. Selections
from the contents of a typical box
will show what kind of material is to be
had. The subject is The recall:</p>

<p>We keep the public informed of what
is taking place in the Illinois legislature
by having a complete file of the house and
senate bills and joint resolutions. These
are carefully indexed so that if a patron
asks for the bills relating to non-partisan
elections, by turning to our index and looking
under Municipalities&mdash;Non-partisan
elections, the bills are easily found. Likewise
the ordinances that are passed by
the city council are treated in the same
way.</p>

<p>We have found from our experience covering
a year's work that the subjects that
have been most used are as follows:</p>


<ul><li>Initiative and referendum</li>
<li>Recall</li>
<li>Woman suffrage</li>
<li>Immigration</li>
<li>Direct election of U. S. senators</li>

<li>Non-partisan elections</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the questions selected at random,
show the demands made upon the
room. A committee of the City Council
is appointed to investigate the question
of public service corporation commissions,
and the library receives a call for material
upon the question "Whether it is better to
have public utilities regulated by state
public service commissions, or to have
them regulated by the City Council."
When the investigation of the telephone
rates is to be made the history of the telephone
investigations carried on by previous
councils is looked up. Upon investigating
the advisability of electrifying the
railway terminals, statistics are demanded
showing the amount of damage that is
done by the smoke of the railroads in the
city limits. Only the live, up-to-date ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>terial
can be of any value to these city
officials, and a knowledge of what other
cities have done relative to these questions
is necessary.</p>

<p>Newspaper men who are doing such excellent
work in keeping the people informed
about what improvements are being
made to better the conditions in the
city, demand a great deal of a civics
room. For example: A newspaper man
writing a series of articles upon how to
improve Chicago, wishing to write an article
on housing, sends in a call for information
regarding Schmidlapp houses, and
it is our business to get him the material.
Again he wishes to show how to reduce
the cost of living, and sends in a request
for information concerning the conveyance
of produce from the farmer to the
consumer by means of the interurban cars.
Or again he wishes to inspire the public
with the desire to beautify the city with
window boxes and flowers and he wishes
to know what European cities are doing
along this line.</p>

<p>Civic associations and women's clubs
are constantly making demands upon our
resources. Such questions as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What material have you from the budget
exhibits of other cities?</p>

<p>Statistics showing the death rate in garden
cities as compared with the death rate
in cities where the population is congested.</p>

<p>The provision of giving the wages of
prisoners to the support of the family.</p>

<p>Public comfort stations.</p>

<p>City planning and garden cities.</p>

<p>The question of working women's wages
in its relation to the social evil was
studied, during the recent investigation of
the Illinois Vice Commission, by students
and women's clubs.</p></div>

<p>Students find our room a boon. They
are able to get material there which they
are not able to find anywhere else. This
spring students at the University of Chicago
were working upon a debate on Panama
Canal tolls, and they were so eager to
use our material that they would stay all
day, leaving in relays to eat while a few
were left behind to guard the material.</p>

<p>A civics room in a medium-sized town
may be made one of the most important
assets of the library if it can be arranged
that the person in charge does not have to
divide her attention with the main work
of the other departments of the library.
If the staff is limited it would be better
to have the civics room situated in a centralized
locality, such as the state library,
with easy communication with the smaller
libraries. These could have an index of
what the state library has, and when the
need would arise the librarian could communicate
her wants to the state librarian
and the material could be sent as a package
library upon short notice.</p>

<p>And so we find that we can be of assistance
to the members of the City Council,
women's clubs, civic organizations, newspaper
men and students. The future of
the work is very bright; new lines of work
open up; new opportunities for service
present themselves. It is in this work that
one can be alive; he can feel that he is a
part of the great movement toward the
betterment of his city and its people.</p>

<p>Dr. William H. Allen, director of the Bureau
of Municipal Research, of New York,
made the closing talk of the evening, taking
as his subject, "What a city should expect
and receive from a library." He made
a plea that librarians as individuals should
stand for something in the community,
should take their place as persons in the
affairs of the day as well as see to it that
their institutions performed the work to
be expected of a library. He also laid
emphasis on the fact that the general public
did not know of the work being done by
libraries and the possibilities of further
service and urged that discussions of such
work should be given place in the general
magazines and newspapers as well as library
magazines. He strongly advocated
individual thinking, the doing of that
which the individual librarian felt to be
the best for a given community whether
it be in line with general library thought
or not, claiming that individuality of action
and thought made for a stronger and better
administration even if such individuality
led to criticism upon occasion.</p>

<h2>PROFESSIONAL TRAINING SECTION</h2>


<p>The meeting was called to order
Wednesday evening, June 25, by the chairman,
Mr. Frank K. Walter.</p>

<p>The first paper was presented by Miss
MARY W. PLUMMER on</p>


<h3>SPECIALIZATION AND GRADING IN
LIBRARY SCHOOLS</h3>

<p>Although it is twenty-five years since
library schools began, one may say that
in a sense they are still in the experimental
stage. And to say this is really
praise, for when schools cease to experiment
they are running along safely in
ruts and have lost much of their vitality.
The same period has been one of great
expansion in library affairs,&mdash;not only has
the country been covered with library
buildings where before, to use a Western
expression, "there was nothing but sagebrush,"
but forms of library work and extension
have sprung up that were undreamed
of twenty-five years ago, new
methods have had to be found to meet
emergencies and new conditions, social,
industrial, and educational, and the library
or library commission without several new
ideas and aspirations per month is not
thought to be doing its full duty. Add to
all this progress the reactions that are
going on, in library practice, in library
architecture, etc., each a faithful reflection
of some new light or of some old light
looked at a second time, and the scene is
one of activity paralleled, so far as the
present writer knows, in no other field of
endeavor, unless it be that of general education.</p>

<p>Several of the schools carry on an exercise
called "survey of the field," merely
to keep their classes in sight of this movement,
and once a fortnight is not too often
for such a class to meet&mdash;there is always
fresh material for discussion.</p>

<p>A school, however, must experiment
within reason and along its own lines. Because
some small libraries and new
branches are taking down their partitions
or building without them is not sufficient
cause for the advocacy of the practice
in the schools; the much mooted question
of the use of the accessions-book must remain
for some time a mooted question in
the schools&mdash;as long, in fact, as the conservative
and radical libraries so evenly
balance each other on the subject. It is
not for the schools to practice or to teach
library innovations&mdash;their business is to
watch innovations and their results and
report to their students.</p>

<p>It is open to the school, however, not only
to watch but to forecast, to some extent.
By dint of observing and listening, one who
is not in the actual game often sees what is
really happening or going to happen before
some, at least, of the participants are entirely
aware of it. An instance lies at hand
in the subject of cataloging. Up to the
present, this has been one of the backbone
courses in every school-schedule,
though the schools report regularly to
their students the progress making in co-operative
cataloging and the use of printed
cards. As this use extends, it becomes
more and more evident that cataloging
is to be concentrated in a few expert hands
and that most librarians are not going to
have to be catalogers any more than the
head of a commercial concern has to know
by heart the price of every article in his
stock, or than a manufacturer has to be
able to do at a moment's notice what his
expert subordinates are doing.</p>

<p>For the present, libraries still exist
which make their own cards, and they
still call on the schools regularly for librarians
who can catalog, and hope rather
than expect to get them. For, in spite of
the fact that the schools still teach every
student to catalog, as far as the student
material will admit, students of their own
volition seldom choose to be catalogers.
Whether they too have sensed the fact that
a change is coming and that the librarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>ship
of the future will have more to do
with the inside of the book and its application
to the individual, with the handling
rather than the making of tools, or whether
they simply do not like what seems to
them the probable monotony of cataloging,
I do not know; but I think the schools
will bear me out in the statement that cataloging
as a specialty is not the first
choice of many students. In view of these
facts, I am ready to hazard the prediction
that within ten years cataloging will be
given in the schools as an elective; and
that instead of making catalogs the majority
of students will be led to consider
the few main principles of cataloging and
then taught better how to use and how to
criticise catalogs.</p>

<p>Every instructor in cataloging knows
that there are students whom it is a waste
of time and vitality to try to make into
catalogers, and every year good people
go out from the schools who should never
be engaged as catalogers and whom the
schools recommend only for their qualifications
for other work. Suppose we concentrated
our teaching ability in this line on
the students who <i>would</i> make good catalogers
and who would elect the study&mdash;we
should be working with the grain and
not across it, the cataloging of the whole
country would be uniformly well done instead
of open to well-founded criticism in
places, as it is now, and the time and
strength of the instructor would be saved
as well as those of the student whose
forte lies in another direction. Another
result would probably follow very quickly&mdash;more
men would go into the library
schools. I am told that the detail of cataloging
seems to a man too much like making
tatting, and one can easily understand
that a person competent and eager to handle
large matters or to fill an active administrative
post would fret over anything
involving as much minuti&aelig; as the making
of catalog cards.</p>

<p>However, while libraries in general are
making their own cards, and while the
smaller libraries have to have librarians
who can turn their hands to anything, cataloging
as well as the rest, it is unsafe for
the schools to send out students without
this part of the training. It is only as
library conditions point overwhelmingly
toward cataloging as a specializing study
that the schools can change.</p>

<p>Librarians can help very greatly in the
matter of specialization by encouraging it
and employing specialists for special work
wherever possible. Without depreciating
in the least the value of an attractive face
and an agreeable manner and of taste in
dress, in library work as elsewhere, I may
perhaps be allowed to put forward the
opinion that the librarian who is choosing
a cataloger should not be unduly
swayed by these to the exclusion of the
other requirements. Accuracy, legibility,
knowledge of books, ability in research
and a taste for it, all go to the making of
a good cataloger, and it is discouraging
for a school to see the graduate who possesses
these qualifications passed over in
favor of one who may have a pleasanter
address but who can not do the work half
so well. And women librarians are swayed
by these considerations almost as much
as men. The school can hardly be said
to blame in such cases&mdash;it can only sorrowfully
shake its head, knowing that if
there is any discredit to be cast upon any
one later, a great part of it will probably
fall upon the school.</p>

<p>Setting aside cataloging as a specialty
in the days to come, to what shall we devote
the large place it has occupied in all
the general curricula?</p>

<p>It is easy to see that with printed cards
and expert service, catalog cards can be
fuller in information, can be critically annotated,
perhaps, can be made more often
for analyticals, subject and author, and
that the use of the catalog by the library
assistant can be much more constant
and more discriminating. Some time can
be given in the curriculum to selecting
from the catalog, securing from the
shelves, examining and comparing the
books on a given subject, with the result
that the student can get a more thorough
knowledge of its literature, greater facility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
in the use of a valuable tool, and may become
more generally intelligent for the
purpose of the selection and buying of
books, and for recommending or the contrary.</p>

<p>Classification and the study of subject-headings
are in themselves so broadening,
furnish so good an exercise of the reasoning
powers, and afford such fine views of
the inter-relations of fields of knowledge,
that I doubt if they can ever or ought
ever to be set aside as special studies. The
study of works of reference, however, offers
so large and comprehensive a field
that it seems to need division; and this
brings me to the other subject of my title,
that of grading in the schools.</p>

<p>Probably no one thing has made teaching
more difficult, than the wide range of age
and experience among the students. In the
same class may occur and do occur continually
the girl of twenty without much reading
beyond high school and college requirements
and the summer novel (unless she
has fortunately grown up in a cultivated
family with the habit of good reading and
of discussing books), and the man or woman
of from thirty to forty with a knowledge
of books, an experience of life and
society, and of thoughtful mind, who may
have been successful in teaching or in
some other profession; and in between
range students of all degrees of cultivation,
varieties of experience, and types of
education. The training fitted for the first
class wastes much of the time of the student
at the other extreme, and if it be
adapted to that extreme may be too strong
or too complicated a mixture for the youngest
student.</p>

<p>Grading would be expensive, for it would
mean more teachers or more specialized
teachers. In some of the schools the
classes are not large enough to admit of so
costly a proceeding; yet without grading,
under the conditions described, the school
belongs where the ungraded school belongs
in the scheme of general education&mdash;it
is delivering a scattering fire that may or
may not hit its object. The entrance examination
has been the device employed
for unifying student-material in some
schools, and it is much better than any
other means, it seems to me; but though
it may show what is the greatest common
divisor of the candidates in the way of
education and offer a definite point of departure
for instruction, those who examine
the papers see such differences, quite
apart from the mere answers to the questions,
as warn them that they are about
to deal with a very varied assortment of
intellects, a wide range of cultivation,
and with necessities ranging from those of
the steady, plodding follower who will never
go further than an average assistantship
to those of the born administrator or
scholar. There is, to be sure, in such a
class great benefit for the younger and
less experienced students from contact
with the others, from discussions that are
a little over their heads, but, all the same,
teaching addressed to the maturer intellect
leaves the other with gaps unfilled,
while teaching brought down to the level
required by youth and inexperience gets
the older student nowhere for the time being.
The process is a sort of hitching
along that should not be necessary in professional
or vocational schools.</p>

<p>Suppose that grading be practicable so
far as money and teachers are concerned.
Where should lines be drawn? Often the
younger person has the more flexible as
well as more open mind and the older student
may be a little set and may have
ceased to take in readily new ideas. How
to distinguish the students who can receive
and assimilate readily the best and most
that can be given? I should say that perhaps
a month might have to be spent in
making the division by actual testing of
the students in class together. With this
secured, two curricula might be offered,
one prepared for the needs of each class
with appropriate methods of teaching, and
offering varied proportions of the same
subjects. And here I revert to the teaching
of reference work. For the higher grade
it would be more inclusive, more difficult,
dealing more with books in foreign languages,
with books on unusual and recon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>dite
subjects, such as would be found in
large reference or college libraries, while
the lower grade might be adapted to the
more elementary work to be done in small
libraries or in branches.</p>

<p>The "moral" of this plan lies largely in
the application of it. If the large reference
or college library could be deflected from
its main object, the securing of a competent
reference assistant, by a sunny smile
on the part of a lower grade student, the
school's work in preparing the better student
would go for naught so far as that library
was concerned, and if this happened
several times it would result in a confusion
of values in the minds of the students. A
+ a sunny smile - a knowledge of
the books would seem to be more than
equal to B + a thorough reference equipment
- a sunny smile. We may paraphrase
here a well-known saying by asserting
that, taking all things together, a librarian
who can make his own choice of
assistants gets the assistants he deserves,
with the further assertion that the word
personality, as often used now, does not
get its full meaning; we forget that it consists
not only of what one looks like and
sounds like and apparently feels like but
of all that one has made one's own out of
the realm of knowledge, and all that one
has assimilated and made profitable from
one's experience.</p>

<p>The charge that the one year's general
course is too full would probably become
less true if or when grading was adopted.
Only those subjects would need be given
to a grade and those amounts of a subject
which the students were capable of profiting
by and the time saved could be used
in more effective ways.</p>

<p>There is a very general desire to study
administration among both older and
younger students. So far as this means
covering the whole routine of a library,
with lectures on library relationships, management,
etc., a course can easily be given;
the difficulty arises when students
wish to go out as administrators on the
strength of such preparation alone; and
when library boards send to the schools
for students to fill administrative positions
and expect the training to ensure administrative
ability which, under the circumstances,
can not be guaranteed. No matter
how friendly may be the attitude of the
library connected with a school, it is hardly
willing to turn over any of its administrative
work to students, nor could it be
expected to do so. The ideal thing, of
course, would be for the school itself to
own a small library as a laboratory in
which students could be tested for administrative
ability under supervision. But
this, too, would take money. When one
sees the splendid endowment of a School
of Journalism, a School of Technology,
etc., one cannot help hoping that some day
a School of Librarianship may be endowed
which may employ the best of teachers
and plenty of them, have its own ample
collections, adapted to its needs, and establish
its own library as a laboratory in
which it may try experiments.</p>

<p>I have not yet touched upon the kind
of specialization of which we have heard
most in late years&mdash;the kind to fit students
to be librarians of special libraries.
I do not believe that the most energetic
critic of the library schools would require
them to teach engineering, commercial
methods, law and medicine. A demand
there certainly is from business houses
and manufactories for librarians, but that
is not enough for the schools. There must
be a corresponding demand from persons
wishing to be trained for such places.
This, so far as I can learn, has not made
itself felt. When applicants begin to come
to the schools saying, "I intend to go into
an applied science library" (or "an insurance
library") "and I want to be trained for
that work and that only," then the schools
will have to provide such training or declare
definitely that that is not a part of
their field. Until such a demand arises
from would-be students, it would be foolish
for a school which has plenty of demand
for general training and certain well-defined
extensions of it to go outside this
province.</p>

<p>A committee of the Special Libraries As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>sociation,
I learn, is investigating the matter
of preparation for special library positions,
and it is to be hoped that there
may be a very thorough inquiry, and that
the committee will state definitely just
what the association wants and what it
believes to be proper training for such
positions. Then the existing schools can
decide whether or not they can give such
preparation.</p>

<p>Meantime, a suggestion that institutes
of technology might take up this special
technical work and commercial schools
the business library courses, etc., may be
worth considering.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the schools
specialize among themselves, and to some
extent that has come about naturally; for
the school with especially good resources
and unusual facilities for teaching a given
subject, such as legislative reference or
work with children, if it makes known its
advantages, is very likely to attract the
student who wishes to follow that line of
work. Other reasons, however, often weigh
more heavily&mdash;the location of a school,
the personnel of the faculty, a smaller tuition
fee, the general reputation and advancement
of its graduates, etc.; so that
any school may be called upon to give
some special work of which perhaps it is
not the best exponent. It cannot send the
student elsewhere willy-nilly, and it does
its best to give him what is wanted. As
schools increase in number, a classification
of them according to curricula is likely
to follow, and this difficulty may be lessened.
Even so, there is always the danger
to be guarded against that students trained
along one line may, through force of circumstances,
take positions requiring a
kind of training which they have not had.
It would be impossible for a mining engineer
to do the work of a mechanical engineer
and vice versa, but in the work of
an average library the cataloger and reference
assistant and children's librarian
must often change places, and any one of
them, rather than be without a position,
would as a rule try to do the work of the
others. If all have had general training,
this would not matter so much, but without
that there would be considerable loss
of efficiency.</p>

<p>In bringing this heterogeneous paper to
an end&mdash;a paper which claims to be nothing
more than a sort of thinking aloud on
some of the problems confronting the
schools, I wish to state some conclusions
that I feel myself coming to: 1. That
we need more good schools. 2. That they
need to send out a larger number of trained
people. 3. That we need longer, more
thorough, and more systematic courses. 4.
That with the larger schools some effort
at grading is desirable. 5. That the schools
would do well to get together and make
a comparative study of their curricula, and
their resources and facilities for special
subjects, and map out tentatively a division
of the field. This, while not binding
upon any school, might serve for guidance,
but no school should monopolize any one
subject unless it is the only school having
proper facilities for giving it.</p>

<h3>CO-OPERATION OF LIBRARIES WITH
LIBRARY SCHOOLS</h3>

<p>Before beginning to talk of the ways in
which libraries might co-operate to better
advantage with library schools, it is but
fair to acknowledge gratefully that many
libraries are already co-operating with us
in a way that often must tax severely their
time and patience. In behalf of the Drexel
Institute library school, I thank most
heartily those libraries that, regardless of
the inconvenience to themselves, allow our
students to go to them for the practice
work that is so valuable to half-fledged librarians.
And in voicing the gratitude of
Drexel, I feel that I am giving utterance
to the feelings of every other school that
sends out its students in the same way.</p>

<p>We can give our students but two weeks
practice work outside of Philadelphia, because
our school year is so short. Perhaps
it would be well to lengthen the year by
two weeks, in order that the term of work
might be lengthened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>There are three things that it seems to
me the schools may properly ask of the
libraries: advance practice work; direct
criticism; a living wage for assistants.</p>

<p>(1) Advance practice work&mdash;I mean by
this work done in libraries prior to any
study of library science. As a rule, the
student with a little practical experience
gets far more from a library course than
one not so equipped. Directors of schools
often advise work in advance, but, as far
as I know, few schools require it. Pratt
Institute begins with practical work in the
Pratt library. The difficulties in the way
of requiring this work are many. It would
bear heavily upon the libraries; it would
be an added expense to students living at
a distance from good libraries; it would
not necessarily prove the applicant's fitness
or unfitness for library work, as she
might fail at the kind of work she was
set to do, and yet be capable of success on
some other line.</p>

<p>Yet, on the whole, this would be a better
test of fitness than all the questions
we directors hurl at kindly and well-meaning
friends or former instructors of our
would-be students. Don't we ask too many
questions as to personality from those
whose answers often carry little weight?
Why should we not accept all who measure
up to a certain physical and mental
standard, without troubling our heads so
much as to whether they are ideally fit for
library work? It would bring us more in
line with the professional schools. Moreover,
there are almost as many kinds of
library work as there are of people!</p>

<p>The chance to work in a real library before
beginning the course of study would
often clarify the student's ideas about library
work, even more than it would clarify
the director's ideas about the would-be
student. We would have, perhaps, fewer
applicants who are not very strong but
who "<b>love</b> books."</p>

<p>Sometimes I have wondered whether it
would not be well to abandon entrance examinations
and require instead a health
certificate from a physician, a certificate
that six months' satisfactory work had
been done in his library from a librarian,
and a statement that the applicant had
read the English Bible through at least
three times (this last for its influence on
English prose style!).</p>

<p>(2) Direct criticism.</p>

<p>"Indirect criticism" was perhaps the
toughest thing in the advanced cataloging
course in my honored Alma Mater,
and indirect criticism is one of the most
trying things that we teachers of library
science have to undergo. Librarians can
help us by giving us their criticism of our
methods and of our students at first-hand.</p>

<p>We have had more or less direct criticism&mdash;we
would like more.</p>

<p>We have been told (a) That our graduates
are not so valuable to certain libraries
as their own apprentices. Of course
they are not, at first, but they should be
more valuable later. (b) That they are
wedded to library school methods. I believe
there is less justice in this criticism
than there was some years ago. (c) That
our schools are not "laid out and conducted
in accordance with recommendations
from experts in pedagogy." We plead
guilty. (d) That the schools "almost inevitably
tend to exalt technique and
routine." I do not think that we mean to
do this. We know that culture and gumption
are more important than any amount
of knowledge of technique and routine, but
we expect our students to finish their cultural
studies (so far as such studies <b>can</b>
be finished) before coming to us, and we
can not teach gumption. It is heaven-born.
We exist largely for the purpose of teaching
technique and routine but never for
one moment do we mean to exalt them
over the weightier matters of the law.</p>

<p>I have gone a little out of the way to
answer these few direct criticisms. Some
of us have profited by them. Give us
more.</p>

<p>We would like direct rather than indirect
criticism of our graduates. Unfavorable
comments on training in general, or
on the training of a particular school, do
not take the place of direct criticism of
individuals. Librarians would be doing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
kindness by writing to the school from
which they had a trained assistant who
was lacking in ways that reflected on her
training and stating plainly what the defects
were, so that the school might profit
by the knowledge.</p>

<p>Then, too, librarians would often save
themselves trouble by co-operating with
the schools to the extent of writing for
the record of a graduate whom they think
of engaging. Many do this, but not all.
A librarian or trustee may select an assistant
at a conference on account of her
good looks and pleasant manners, and
when he finds out (it is usually a "he" who
makes this error of judgment) that she
is not all his fancy painted her, he blames
the school that trained her. The school
could have told him perhaps, if asked,
wherein she was lacking.</p>

<p>(3) A living wage. This is the most
important of the three points in which we
wish for co-operation. It is getting to be
a serious question as to whether women
of ability can afford to go into library
work. We do not expect luxuries, but to
do good work we must keep fit. We need
rooms that admit plenty of fresh air and
we need nourishing food. We are obliged
to dress fairly well. We ought to go to
library meetings, and trustees do not usually
pay the way of the assistants with
the smaller salaries. Recreation is a necessity
if we are to keep sane. But how
can we afford to travel, or even to see a
play or to buy a book, on the salaries many
of us get?</p>

<p>I was asked a few weeks ago to supply
a college library with a cataloger who
must be a library school graduate knowing
French and German and the salary offered
was $40 a month. If a woman ate poor
food, she might be able to save enough out
of $40 to pay for her washing&mdash;only she
couldn't afford to buy any clothes to be
washed. She could never see a play, hear
an orchestra, or buy a book.</p>

<p>A good cook, on the other hand, would
have no difficulty in getting $30 or $35
a month <b>and maintenance</b>, which would
be equivalent to a salary of at least $50
or $55 a month. Moreover, the cook would
not be expected to dress as well as the cataloger
(though, as a matter of fact, her
Sunday clothes would probably be more
costly) or to attend conventions.</p>

<p>The case I have mentioned is by no
means an isolated one. A good-looking
girl with pleasant manners, who could
understand French, German, Spanish and
Italian over the telephone, was asked for
by a large city library that proposed to pay
about $45 a month. Another college library
recently wanted a college and library
school graduate with experience and
various other qualifications for $720 a
year. Now if an <b>experienced</b> woman with
such an education can't get more than
$720 a year in library work, the sooner
she leaves it for something else the better.
A special library belonging to a leading
institution in a large city was looking
for a woman to reclassify and catalog its
collection, but seemed unwilling to pay
even $50 a month.</p>

<p>This is not intended as a diatribe
against the librarian employer. The trustees
and the taxpayers need education
along the line of library salaries. Libraries
need larger appropriations for salaries.
We have passed through a period
where method was exalted, we seem to
be passing through a period where a fine
building is the prime necessity. But after
all, a library means primarily plenty of
books that are worth while and assistants
that know enough to get them into the
hands of the right people. And we can
not cultivate efficient assistants on less
than a living wage.</p>

<p>Do not misunderstand me. I do not
mean to imply that a green library school
graduate should leap at once into a high-salaried
position. Yet the comparison
sometimes made with the doctor or lawyer,
who are so long in gaining a foot-hold,
seems to me unfair. Lawyers and doctors
who are good for much, make big money
after a while. It is the exceptional librarian
who ever gets a large salary. Therefore
it is not fair to expect her to spend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
so many years earning little or nothing as
does the doctor or lawyer.</p>

<p>I have spoken particularly of salaries
for women. Salaries for men in library
work are usually too low, but I have dwelt
on the women's salaries because women
are discriminated against, not alone in libraries,
but in most kinds of work done by
women.</p>

<p>The working-woman of today asks no
favor because she is a woman. She does
ask equal pay with men for equally good
work.</p>

<p>I do not mean to over-emphasize the
money side of library work, even though
I think the "missionary" side of it has been
over-emphasized. Why is a shelf-lister
any more of a missionary than a bookkeeper
in John Wanamaker's store? Why
is any librarian any more of a missionary
than the editor of a great daily, or than
a busy surgeon, or many other folks that
might be mentioned? We librarians serve
those who know more than we, who are
better than we&mdash;we are "just folks" like
all the rest, equally worthy, if we give
good measure in our work, of a living
wage.</p>

<p>We of the schools ask of the libraries
we try to serve that they send us criticisms
of our graduates, that they try them
out, and that they pay them, if found efficient,
that living wage without which
the best work is impossible.</p>

<h3>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
METHODS OF PUBLICITY FOR
LIBRARY SCHOOLS</h3>

<p>The Committee on Methods of Publicity
respectfully reports to the Professional
Training Section as follows:</p>

<p>At the time of the mid-winter meeting
at Chicago the members of this Committee
met and after consultation with the
Secretary of the A. L. A. determined upon
a procedure which was carried out as follows:</p>

<p>It was deemed wise to make an effort
to reach the students in the colleges and
universities through the publication of an
article in each of the periodicals published
in the various colleges. One form of letter
was framed for co-educational institutions,
one form for use at men's colleges and one
form for use at women's colleges. These
were mimeographed and Mr. Utley, who
had already prepared a list of college publications,
mailed the letter to over 180 publications.</p>

<p>The letter was in no sense an advertisement
of library schools; it was rather an
attempt to set forth facts relative to the
opportunities within the library profession.
It called attention to the existence of the
various library schools and referred the
interested student to the college librarian
or to the Secretary of the A. L. A.</p>

<p>Although the Committee flattered itself
it had produced a helpful and interesting
letter, it cannot learn that it was reprinted
to any considerable extent nor that it resulted
in interesting many students in the
profession.</p>

<p>The Committee is informed that in
many, if not in most, of the educational
institutions of the country there are
groups of persons interested in vocational
training. It is therefore recommended
that this publicity work be continued, but
that the approach for the publication of
the article and for the local use of it be
made through the persons or groups in
each institution which are particularly interested
in vocational training. In most
cases these persons have an established
channel of publicity and can reach the
students and the publications better than
they can be reached through the direct attack
heretofore employed.</p>

<h3>ACCOUNT OF THE WINTER MEETINGS
OF LIBRARY SCHOOL INSTRUCTORS</h3>

<p>In January, 1911, 1912 and 1913, there
were held in Chicago, meetings of library
school directors and instructors for the
discussion of topics connected with library
school work. While at first thought
it might seem that such discussions should
form a part of the programs of this, the
Professional Training Section, nevertheless,
the meetings have evidently justified
themselves and are likely to continue.</p>

<p>Members of the faculties of only the
generally recognized library schools have
attended these meetings; that is, the plans
of the meetings do not contemplate the
attendance of instructors in summer library
schools or instructors in training
classes conducted by public libraries. This
limitation on the number of people taking
part in these meetings was desired, first,
because we who arranged the meetings
wished to discuss problems belonging primarily
to our own special work and not
to attempt the larger field which properly
belongs to the Professional Training Section;
and second, because we wished the
meetings to be sufficiently small in numbers
and the participants to be sufficiently
specialized in interest to insure informal
and frank discussion.</p>

<p>Minutes of these meetings of library
school faculties have included copies of
reports presented and in some cases have
included abstracts of discussions. Copies
have been sent to each school.</p>

<p>Some of the topics discussed would be
of no general interest to even the Professional
Training Section, as they pertain
so closely to school work. Others are
of such a nature that we ourselves would
not, with any freedom, discuss them before
as large a meeting as a section meeting.
Our frank, informal discussions have
been characteristic.</p>

<p>Among the questions proposed for discussion
and sent to the various faculties
in advance of the meeting, are such as
these:</p>

<p>1. Is it desirable, and if desirable, is it
practicable to make the work of the first
year of the two-year schools and the work
of the one-year schools more nearly alike?
Many junior students in a two-year school
enter library work without taking the
senior year's work; if the courses in one-year
schools are better preparation for library
work than the first year's work of
the two-year schools, then these juniors
are at a disadvantage as compared with
students from a one-year school. Some
students in the one-year schools may wish
to go to a two-year school and take a second
year of training; as the courses are
at present arranged, this second year's
work is almost impossible, because it does
not fit on to the work that the student
has had.</p>

<p>2. Do we use the most approved pedagogical
methods in our class room work?
Do we lecture too much, and give too
few quizzes, conferences and reviews? Do
we depend too much on the student's taking
full notes, when the proper use of
printed outlines, or carefully selected required
readings supplemented by a few
notes would yield better results? Shall
the course in cataloging be put at the beginning
of the course, or later? How
much do we use the stereopticon?</p>

<p>3. Would it be practicable for several
schools to secure a lecturer on some special
subject in library economy who should
give the regular work in that subject in
each of these schools? An example of a
beginning in this direction is Edna Lyman
Scott's work in several schools.</p>

<p>4. Would it be possible for the several
schools to combine in securing a lecturer
each year to give a short series of lectures
on some one subject, these lectures
to be seriously worked up, and to be published
after being delivered? The final
publication of the lectures, and the combined
remuneration from several schools,
might be a sufficient incentive to capable
persons to do their best work.</p>

<p>5. Are the subjects now in our curricula
properly balanced? Is too much time
given to learning cataloging and other
routine, and consequently too little to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
consideration of methods of extending the
use of the library by the public?</p>

<p>6. Is it as easy to secure transfer of
credit from one school to another as it
should be?</p>

<p>Information on the following subjects
connected with library school work has
been collected, reported on and discussed
in our meetings.</p>

<p>1. The cost of library schools and a
rough analysis of their expenditures.</p>

<p>2. Specialization among library schools.</p>

<p>3. Book selection as a course in library
schools.</p>

<p>4. The method of revising students'
work.</p>

<p>5. Efficiency of administration in library
schools.</p>

<p>6. Non-essentials in our library school
courses.</p>

<p>7. Certain pedagogical problems connected
with our library school instruction.</p>

<p>The following officers were elected for
the coming year: Chairman, Corinne Bacon;
Secretary, Julia A. Hopkins; Program
committee, Mary W. Plummer, Alice
S. Tyler, Frank K. Walter.</p>

<h2>PUBLIC DOCUMENTS ROUND TABLE</h2>


<p>The government documents round table
was called together at 8:15 p. m., June
26th, by George S. Godard, state librarian
of Connecticut, chairman of the committee
on public documents. Mr. F. W. Schenk,
law librarian of the University of Chicago,
was asked to serve as secretary.</p>

<p>The chairman, after brief introductory
remarks relating to the progress which
had been made in the matter of printing,
binding, labeling and distributing public
documents, both national and state, introduced
Miss Mary A. Hartwell, assistant
chief cataloger in the office of the superintendent
of documents, Washington, who
read a paper prepared by Superintendent
of Documents Frank C. Wallace, stating
his position upon the many questions and
resolutions suggested at previous conferences
of the American Library Association
relative to the distribution, indexing, assignment
of volume numbers, and publication
of daily bulletins by the document
office.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace's paper follows:</p>


<h3>PAPER BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF
DOCUMENTS</h3>

<p>I regret the necessity of being compelled
to adopt this means of addressing your Association,
as I feel a better understanding
could be had of what we are trying to do
for the libraries if it were possible for this
office to be represented at your conference.
I have read with much interest the proceedings
of your last conference, and a
part of my paper will endeavor to explain
some of the questions which were discussed
and made the subject of resolutions.</p>

<p><b>Distribution of Bills and Other Publications
Now Withheld From Distribution
to the Libraries.</b></p>

<p>There is no doubt but that some
libraries, even under the present liberal
distribution of government publications,
fail to receive everything they should, and
I am thoroughly in accord with the opinion
expressed during your discussion that
means should be provided to enable the
libraries to receive those publications of a
public character that are now withheld
from distribution. It is gratifying to note
that in Senator Smoot's printing bill, which
has been reintroduced in the present Congress,
there are provisions intended to supply
remedies for certain existing conditions.</p>

<p>Section 65, paragraph 1, to which I refer,
provides that a sufficient number of copies
of those publications of Congress which do
not bear a congressional number, including
the committee publications now withheld
from distribution to depositories and those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
printed elsewhere than at the government
printing office, shall be supplied to the
libraries. It is also worded so as to prevent
the departments from withholding
some of their publications from the depositories.</p>

<p>The printing committee no doubt had in
mind when this provision was framed that,
under the provisions of the existing law,
too much discretion is given the departments,
with the result that, contrary to the
spirit of the printing law, libraries are being
deprived of certain classes of publications
that are really of a public character.</p>

<p>The question as to the best method to be
employed in the distribution of bills is not
so easy of solution. It would not be practicable
for this office to attempt to carry
even a limited supply, as the work involved
in storing them in an accessible
manner would involve an expenditure that
I do not believe could be justified by the
results.</p>

<p>During the 62d Congress there were introduced
28,870 House bills and 8,589 Senate
bills, and you can readily see that to
handle an adequate stock of all those bills
would be considerable of an undertaking.
At the present time the only distributing
agencies for copies of bills are the House
and Senate document rooms at the capitol,
but, although they sometimes furnish bills
on request, the copies they receive are not
intended for general public distribution. It
seems to me that the solution supplied in
your suggestion, that the text of all public
bills upon which committee reports are
made should be printed with the reports,
is the most logical one that has ever been
presented, but it would not be practicable
to include also the testimony taken at hearings
held by the committees, for in many
cases the testimony would fill several large
volumes. Besides, section 65, already referred
to, provides that the libraries shall
receive such hearings. Of course this section
is not yet law, but we are permitted
to hope that it may become so.</p>

<p>This is desirable from more than one
point of view. It is often the case that
committee reports refer to sections of the
bill under consideration by number without
quoting the language. In such cases
the report may be unintelligible to any
reader who has not a copy of the bill before
him. In fact, nearly all committee reports
not accompanied by the bills to
which they relate may properly be classed
as incomplete and imperfect publications.</p>

<p>The question of cost involved in printing
the text of bills as appendixes to the committee
reports upon them is not serious.
While the number of bills introduced in
Congress and receiving a first print is
prodigious, and the cost of printing them
in 14-point type with as many white lines
as type lines is tremendous, it must be remembered
that only a very small percentage
of the bills introduced ever get so far
as a committee report, and of these a considerable
number are already printed with
the reports by order of the committees,
and the cost of printing the remainder in
solid 8-point is so very much less than the
cost of printing them in the extended bill
form that it is almost negligible.</p>

<p>I do not think it is too late for the Association
to submit to the joint committee
on printing an amendment providing for
the printing of the text of bills and resolutions
as appendixes to the committee reports
upon them. The pending bill may
not pass, or may be extensively amended
before passage, or may not be acted upon
at the present special session, but I consider
it probable that a general printing
law of some kind will be enacted at a comparatively
early day, and that the American
Library Association may, by proper effort,
secure the incorporation in it of the
desired provision for the printing of the
text of bills with the committee reports.</p>


<h4>Reasons Why Catalogs and Indexes Cannot
Be Issued More Promptly</h4>

<p>The need for the prompt issue of the
catalogs is thoroughly appreciated, as we
understand they are the only means of information
the general public have for
knowing what the United States government
is publishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>The Monthly Catalog is required to show
what documents have been published during
a month. Evidently, therefore, its
compilation cannot be completed until
after the close of the month. The compilation,
however, is always completed
within three or four days after the month
closes. Sometimes the printing does not
follow as quickly as one would like. This
may seem strange to libraries, to whom the
Monthly Catalog is perhaps the most important
of all the public documents. If,
however, they were in Washington they
would soon realize that there are several
other government concerns, some of them
larger and more exacting than the public
documents office. There is one known as
the Congress of the United States, which
calls for thousands of pages of printing
where the documents office calls for one,
and which, when it calls for the right of
way in the government printing office (or
anywhere else), is able to get it. The
printing of the document office receives
every consideration in the government
printing office which it is possible to give,
but it cannot command the right of way
over Congress, the White House, or the
cabinet.</p>

<p>It has been a long time since the
Monthly Catalog has failed to be mailed
during the month following its date, often
by the middle of the month. It is to be
noted, also, that its information is quite
different from that of "press notices." It
enters only documents that have been actually
received, and its descriptions are
minute and accurate. In its preliminary
pages it gives such advance information of
forthcoming documents as can be officially
secured and vouched for. There is a habit
in some government offices of giving the
newspaper reporters information of proposed
publications before the copy is ready
for the printer, and sometimes before pen
has been put to paper. Plans thus prematurely
announced are subject to change
and the advance notice may thus mislead
the reader. Readers of the Monthly Catalog
are not thus misled.</p>

<p>The superintendent of documents is confident
that those librarians who keep well
informed recognize his purpose to do
everything for the great library interests
of the country that the limitations of the
law and the executive pressure upon his
and other administrative offices for economy
make possible.</p>

<p>The main cause for delay in the preparation
of the copy for the document catalogs
and indexes is that publications are ordered
printed as documents that do not
materialize until long after the close of
the Congress to which they have been assigned,
thus making it necessary to delay
publication of the catalog and indexes until
sufficient information can be obtained
for making the entry.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to explain why
the document catalog is being issued in
one volume to cover the entire Congress
instead of at the close of each regular session,
as provided by law, because a very
complete and detailed explanation has
been given in several of the annual reports.
It is evident our explanation has
been considered satisfactory by the printing
committee, as the new printing bill
provides for the document catalog to cover
a whole Congress.</p>

<p>I will also refrain from a long discourse
as to why the work on the catalogs has
been behind, as I know the librarians are
only interested as to the promptness in the
printing of these bibliographical aids in the
future. The copy for the 61st Congress
catalog will be ready for the printer sometime
during the coming summer and that
for the 62d Congress before the adjournment
of the 63d Congress, which will be as
near as it will be possible to issue this
catalog after the period covered.</p>

<p>This leaves it to the Monthly Catalog
and the Document Index to bridge the gap
and supply the current information from
one Document Catalog to another, which,
although not as complete and as comprehensive
as the Document Catalog, serve as
excellent substitutes during the interim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>


<h4>Assignment of Volume Numbers to the
Congressional Series</h4>

<p>There is probably no question concerning
public documents to which this office
has given more consideration than the devising
of a plan by which it would be possible
to assign the volume numbers to the
congressional series as soon as the documents
are printed.</p>

<p>There are two very material advantages
to be gained, were it possible to solve this
question; one that of eliminating the necessity
for the public printer to supply
storage room for these documents and reports
prior to the preparation of the
schedule; and the other that the work of
the librarians in cataloging these documents
and reports would be greatly facilitated
by having all of the necessary information
at the time the publication was
cataloged. The greatest handicap to a
solution of this problem is the lack of information
concerning the publications
which have not been printed and to which
document numbers have been assigned.
Even now, after the session is closed, we
are compelled to hold up the schedule for
weeks and sometimes months to learn the
title, paging, and other necessary information
regarding certain publications to
which numbers have been assigned, but
which are not printed.</p>

<p>At the present time in preparing the
schedule, we endeavor to maintain a
numerical arrangement in binding the
Senate and House Reports after having
classified them as public or private in accordance
with the provisions of the printing
law. The Senate documents are
brought together first by subject and then
by number, but, with the House documents,
on account of the introduction in this
series of all the annual and serial publications,
an effort is made to preserve, as far
as possible, a departmental and subject arrangement.</p>

<p>It might be well to explain at this point
that, although the only volumes distributed
to the libraries now as numbered congressional
publications are those of which Congress
is the author, and of these there are
consequently no other editions, the schedules
and index must of necessity, on account
of the wording of the law at the
present time, be made to cover a complete
numbered set still provided for the exclusive
use of Congress.</p>

<p>There is about only one way to accomplish
the numbering of the volumes as
soon as printed under the present law, and
that is by disregarding entirely any sort
of an arrangement and assigning the next
open volume number as the documents and
reports appear. Of course, the index would
furnish the key to these miscellaneous volumes.
Such a plan is now being considered
by us, and it is hoped that before July
1 some plan can be devised which will permit
of a more prompt shipment of the
documents and reports to the libraries.</p>


<h4>Publication of a Daily Bulletin</h4>

<p>The resolution of the Association passed
at Pasadena, May, 1911, favoring the publication
of a daily or weekly bulletin of the
document issues by the superintendent of
documents, has not been forgotten or overlooked,
but up to the present time the
project appears no more feasible than it
did at the beginning.</p>

<p>The documents office has not the authority
of initiative except to a very
limited extent. Its activities are all prescribed
and defined by law. It is from the
law that the superintendent of documents
derives his authority to compile and publish
the Monthly Catalog, the Document
Index, the Document Catalog, and the
series of price lists. It would hardly be
proper or prudent for him to begin the issue
of another periodical without first asking
the permissive or directory action of
Congress. Asking does not always mean
getting. Legislation concerning the document
service has been found heretofore
somewhat slow and difficult in the securing.
I do not feel that I could predict with
any confidence that legislation authorizing
a daily or weekly bulletin could be secured
at all.</p>

<p>If it could, an appropriation to make it
operative would be needed, because it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
not practicable for the members of the
present cataloging force to undertake any
new work. They are working under high
pressure to bring the Document Catalog up
to date and to keep the Document Index
and the Monthly Catalog there.</p>

<p>The embarrassment caused librarians by
calls for documents which have been noticed
in the newspapers but not yet announced
in the Monthly Catalog is not so
much due to delay of the Monthly Catalog
as to premature announcement in the
newspapers. It is the practice of various
government bureaus to pass along to the
newspaper men information of new publications
as soon as they are sent to press
or even sooner. Of course readers of the
newspapers assume that the documents noticed
are already available for sale or distribution,
whereas the fact is that various
causes may tie up the documents in press
for months or even years. The most
prolific cause of such delays is changes&mdash;changes
in "copy," changes in "proof,"
changes even to the substitution of entirely
new matter after a first draft has
been put in type. The number and extent
of such changes in printing the public documents
are almost unbelievable, and they
are of course highly embarrassing to the
libraries and to the public when premature
announcement of the forthcoming issue of
the delayed document has been made.</p>

<p>If the publishing bureaus could be induced
to withhold information of new documents
until such documents had been actually
printed, bound, and delivered, the
embarrassment experienced by librarians
would be obviated. It is hardly practicable,
however, for the superintendent of documents
to make any suggestion in the matter
to the publishing offices. Some of them
at least would be likely to resent such a
suggestion from him as being meddlesome
and out of his sphere. As to whether such
suggestion from the American Library Association
would be welcomed or heeded, I
do not venture to express an opinion.</p>

<p>Premature announcements are not always
accurate. The announced publications
are often changed in the making, and
sometimes are not published at all.</p>

<p>Of course, the Monthly Catalog, being an
official document and an accurate one, cannot
take any chances on premature announcements.
All of its entries stand for
documents actually received, carefully examined,
and their origin fully inquired
into. This is not work to be hastily done.
Sometimes a surprising amount of time
and trouble are expended in finding out
whether a document belongs in some
series, whether it is the beginning or ending
of that series; if the latter, then
whether the same subject or subjects are
to be pursued in some other series, and the
variety of similar details which libraries
and collectors should have, and for which
they look to the documents office, because
in too many cases such particulars cannot
be ascertained by examination of the document
itself.</p>

<p>A month is the shortest time in which
such matters can be sifted out and brought
into orderly catalog form. Lists issued at
any shorter intervals must necessarily be
memoranda rather than catalogs, and the
work done on them must be performed
again in a more orderly manner for the
official monthly, annual, and biennial catalogs.</p>


<h4>Explanation of Section 8 of the Legislative
Appropriation Act Centralizing the
Distribution in the Office of the
Superintendent of Documents</h4>

<p>The long cherished hope for a central
distributing office has been realized nominally,
but the provisions of law creating it,
I am sorry to say, correct only the evils
that existed from a mechanical standpoint,
in that they prevent the double hauling
and wrapping that were necessary prior to
the change. There remain as many distributing
agencies as before, as the authority
to distribute the publications consigned
to this office continues with the issuing
office. The libraries have been afforded
no relief, because now, as before, if
a dozen selected pamphlets are wanted, it
may mean the writing to about as many
different places. This is a rather difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
proceeding, as most persons are unfamiliar
with the machinery of the government and
are frequently in doubt whom to address to
secure the desired publications. The departments
have always been rather reluctant
to relinquish control of the distribution
of their documents, and the new printing
bill, should it be enacted as it now reads,
would give back to them even the mailing
of the daily miscellaneous requests.</p>

<p>Instead of providing for such a step
backward, it is the opinion of this office
that a provision should be inserted that
would discontinue entirely the free distribution
by the departments (except to collaborators
and sufficient copies for official
use), and would permit the superintendent
of documents to supply free copies to public
libraries and sell copies to the public at
a nominal cost.</p>

<p>At the present time the departments
have only a limited supply, which results
in a few applicants obtaining free what
others have to pay for.</p>

<p>There is probably not a librarian who
hasn't experienced the inconvenience of
the present arrangement, as it is a daily
occurrence for us to have to refer their requests
to the issuing office or quote the
prices.</p>


<h4>Need for Co-Operation on the Part of the
Librarians to Improve the Publication
and Distribution Methods of
Government Publications</h4>

<p>The most striking example of the need
for co-operation is that we are today fighting
for certain reforms in the methods of
publication that were asked for sixteen
years ago.</p>

<p>The first superintendent of documents
had hardly entered upon the duties of the
office before he recognized the faulty
methods of publication and distribution
which he well knew served only to prevent
the public document from occupying the
position its general standard of efficiency
warranted.</p>

<p>It is hard to understand why the untiring
efforts of those interested in promoting
the use of the public document have been
practically ignored when you stop to think
of the annual cost in compilation, printing,
and distribution.</p>

<p>We all know that every conceivable subject
is treated in the public documents, and
when we think of their value to the historian,
student, and public in general, it is
hard to understand why any obstacles
should be put in the way of making them
readily accessible and encouraging the librarians
to give them the proper place on
their shelves.</p>

<p>Now, as to the faulty methods which obtain
in the publication of the public documents,
very little has been accomplished
in the way of reform. That the present
methods cause needless expense in mechanical
production and needless difficulties
in their use, there is no question. Chief
of these faulty methods is that of reprinting
the same book several times under different
numbers and titles. I do not mention
this as a new discovery, because
every superintendent of documents has endeavored
to have the law changed to eliminate
from the congressional series those
publications of which a departmental edition
is printed.</p>

<p>One edition for one book is the only
logical manner of issuing government publications,
and the Smoot bill which has
again been introduced goes a long way
towards correcting the present evil.</p>

<p>Section 45 provides that all publications
of which there is a department edition
printed, except the annual reports of the
executive departments, shall not be numbered
in the congressional series, and section
65 provides that all copies additional
to the original order of the department
should be identical with those ordered by
the department.</p>

<p>We are seriously opposed to the exception
of the annual reports, and with the
hopes of eliminating any exceptions we
have just written the Senate committee on
printing as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"No reason is known to this office why
the annual reports of the executive departments
and independent offices should be
excepted from the operation of the salu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>tary
provision that departmental publications
shall not be printed a second time
with changes to indicate (erroneously)
that they are documents emanating from
Congress.</p>

<p>"The reasons which have induced the
prohibition of second and varying prints of
department publications generally, apply
with at least equal force to the annual reports,
which are the most distinctively and
obviously departmental of all departmental
issues. They are so distinctive that it is
safe to say they are always known and
called for by their departmental designations,
never by their congressional numbers.
Everybody knows at once what is
meant by War Department Report, 1912,
but nobody knows offhand what is meant
by House Document 929, 62d Congress, 3d
session. There is nothing whatever to indicate
that these two designations mean
the same publication, which is really not a
House document at all, but a publication
of the executive and not of the legislative
branch of the government. And, of course,
the same is true of the annual reports of
all the executive officials.</p>

<p>"The addition of congressional document
numbers to executive reports adds nothing
to their value or to their accessibility. The
second set of designations is merely confusing
and troublesome. To spend money
on such a second print is to spend it only
to buy harm instead of good.</p>

<p>"The numerous and conclusive considerations
which have been sufficient to place
in the bill the prohibition of the second
and superfluous editions of other departmental
publications apply with at least
equal if not even greater force to annual
reports, and to except them from the general
prohibition seems therefore illogical
and contradictory and a long step toward
defeating the proposed reform and the
economies which it is intended to promote.</p>

<p>"If it is not desirable to protect the annual
reports from the waste and confusion
of double editions, then it is hard to see
why any publications should be so protected.
The annual reports, so numerous,
so important, so certain to be continuously
issued for all time to come, are 'the very
head and front of the offending' in the
double printing abuse, and with them the
reform should begin.</p>

<p>"To except the annual reports seems to
amount to discrediting if not to virtually
abandoning the whole reform&mdash;the most
vital of all reforms in connection with the
public printing, that of permitting but one
edition for each publication, by which it
may always be known and identified and
kept free from confusion with others."</p></div>

<p>There is no question that the librarians
are in sympathy with what we are trying
to do, so now is the time to join forces and
make every effort to have this bill embody
the necessary provisions to correct all existing
evils.</p>

<p>The librarians must give the movement
impetus, and we believe if sufficient organized
effort is directed in the proper channels
good results will be bound to follow.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace's paper was received with
enthusiasm because it showed his close
and intimate knowledge of matters pertaining
to the publication and distribution
of documents. A spirited discussion followed
the reading of the paper, all through
which expressions of appreciation were
made concerning the service which had
been rendered by the document office in
recent years towards prompt and efficient
distribution of publications delivered to
that office.</p>

<p>Miss Hartwell, informally representing
the superintendent of documents, answered
many questions relative to the
serial numbers on government documents
and urged if consistent with the policy of
the American Library Association that action
be taken suggesting to Congress that
annual reports now listed in the congressional
set of documents be omitted inasmuch
as they are not now in the depository
set and such omission would facilitate the
publication of the Documentary Index.</p>

<p>The discussion also brought out the consensus
of opinion that the libraries would
be more satisfactorily served if all publications
were sent out under the direction
of the superintendent of documents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry J. Carr, librarian of the Scranton
public library; Miss Edith E. Clarke of
Syracuse University, and Herbert O. Brigham,
state librarian of Rhode Island, were
appointed a special committee to prepare
a suitable resolution of thanks to Mr. Wallace
for his excellent paper and to draft
suitable resolutions to be submitted to the
Council for its approval, urging that the
recommendations in Mr. Wallace's paper
relative to publication and distribution of
documents be approved by the American
Library Association, this committee to report
at an adjourned meeting of the session
to be held at 12:15 p. m. on Friday.</p>

<p>The second paper of the evening, prepared
by Mr. FRANCIS A. CRANDALL of
Washington, D. C., on certain phases of the
public document question, in his absence
was read by Charles F. D. Belden, state
librarian of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Mr. Crandall's paper (in part) here follows:</p>


<h3>PROPOSING AN EXECUTIVE GAZETTE</h3>

<p>The committee on department methods,
known to the public as the Keep commission,
was the agency through which, about
seven years ago, President Roosevelt
hoped to reorganize and energize the government
service in Washington.</p>

<p>The Keep commission organized for
helpers twelve so-called assistant committees,
their total membership being
about seventy, all supposed to be experts
in the several branches of inquiry assigned
to them.</p>

<p>On one of these assistant committees,
the one on "The organization of editorial
work and an official gazette," the writer
had the honor to serve.</p>

<p>We held more than one hundred meetings,
and examined as witnesses almost if
not quite every man and woman who had
any official relation with the work of preparing
manuscripts for printing. We
learned after a while that the President
wanted an official gazette, and expected us
to devise the means of creating it. I think
that nearly all the members from the start
deemed the scheme impracticable and
chimerical. It became clear that it would
be a costly enterprise, and we could not
find any department that had the money
for it.</p>

<p>Soon after this Mr. Keep left Washington,
and the Keep commission, though
nominally still living, dwindled rapidly,
and brought forth little if any more fruit.</p>

<p>The members of the assistant committees
were left stranded, with desks full
of unprinted manuscripts as the only results
of their prolonged labors. From one
of these desks I have withdrawn the report
of a subcommittee of the assistant committee
on the organization of editorial
work and an official gazette. Though it was
written half a dozen years ago, it seems
that an element of interest yet remains in
its proposal for the publication, as an alternative
to the impracticable official gazette,
of an executive gazette. This proposal
has not had any exploitation whatever.</p>

<p>In the hope that it may in this way be
brought to the general notice of persons interested
in the methods of publication and
preservation of the historical records of
the government it is now offered for the
consideration of the American Library Association.</p>

<p>The London Gazette, which is the model
most generally thought of when the term
official gazette is used, was begun in 1665,
and may be looked upon as a survival of
the pre-newspaper age, for though there
were newspapers before the Gazette, they
bore little resemblance to what we now
know by that name, and the daily press&mdash;the
significant part of the press of our day&mdash;was
not born till a generation later. We
may assume that when the Gazette was begun
its semi-weekly issues were sufficient
to carry all the official information that the
government of that day wished to offer to
its subjects. But this long since ceased to
be true. The English government now has
a host of publications which do not appear
in either of the three Gazettes&mdash;London,
Edinburgh, and Dublin&mdash;of the United
Kingdom, nor in any of the multitude of
gazettes which are issued in the various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
British dependencies, from Canada and
Australia to Borneo and the Andaman Islands.
The country has outgrown the London
Gazette, and by its growth has been
forced into that specialization and subdivision
of its official publications which we
see even more notably in our own country.
No doubt for the Andaman Islands a
monthly gazette covers the whole ground,
everything being printed in it and no occasion
being found for any other official
publication whatever. This may be true
of many small countries, but it is not conceivable
for a great and growing country
like ours.</p>

<p>The specialization of official publications
seems to be an inevitable result of the
growth of public interests and the public
service. By recent methods documents
are printed relating to special branches of
the public service and sent only to those
employed in such branches. Economy of
both time and labor as well as economy in
printing are thus promoted. This subdivision
is carried out with much minuteness.
The Daily Bulletin of the Railway
Mail Service, relating solely to the affairs
which its title indicates, is printed in
Washington in an edition of 1,500 copies
and supplied to all offices in the department
and sent out to the different division
superintendents throughout the country.
These superintendents extract from it the
matters which affect their divisions and
redistribute these parts to their subordinates
in general orders. Thus everybody
in the postal service gets that information
and those orders which he needs and he
does not get and consequently does not
waste any time upon that information and
those orders which he does not need. The
hydrographic office's weekly, Notice to
Mariners, containing only the latest information
as to aids and hindrances to navigation,
would seem to be a sufficiently
specialized publication to be supplied to
sailors without further ado. Part of the
edition is issued in the complete form, but
economy and efficiency are further promoted
by additional subdivision. The
weekly publication, not a large one to begin
with, is split into many parts, often a
dozen or a score, and one of these leaflets
is supplied to the mariner who needs information
as to those waters only into
which his own voyage will carry him. The
Yearbook of Agriculture, the Annual Reports
of the Smithsonian Institution, the
National Museum, the American Historical
Association, the Chief of Engineers, the
Chief of Ordnance, the Bureau of Education,
and other publications which are
made up of distinct papers or chapters that
permit of separate publication, are split up
and each chapter or paper printed in a
pamphlet by itself, so that the authors and
others who ask for copies of special papers
may have these alone and the cost of
supplying them with whole volumes thus
be saved. Even pamphlets of moderate
size, like the bulletins of the Department
of Agriculture which report the proceedings
of the conventions of official agricultural
chemists, economic entomologists,
and other bodies of government specialists,
are split into fascicules with which the
popular demand for information on special
parts of the work of these scientific bodies
may be met at least cost.</p>

<p>Any publication, by whatever name or in
whatever form, which undertook to include
all of these and the other and almost innumerable
specialized publications of the
government, and to have itself supplied to
all who now receive the existing publications,
would of necessity be of enormous
bulk and be printed in an enormous edition,
and it seems to your committee that it
must break down of its own weight. We
think it absolutely essential to the success
of an official gazette that all of these
specialized class publications should be
most rigorously excluded from its pages.
Specialization seems to be a natural and
proper development of the public printing,
and it would hardly be practicable, or wise
if practicable, to arrest it.</p>

<p>For these reasons, your committee, in
casting about for material which might
properly and usefully be carried in an official
gazette, should one be issued, has endeavored
to choose that only which is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
interest to all classes and not alone to any
one class, whether in or out of the public
service. The list which represents the
judgment of the committee in this respect
is still very long. We have not suggested
the discontinuance of any publication on
account of its inclusion in a gazette, because
in all the letters we have received
from public officials, and all the questions
we have asked them, we have not yet
found one who is of opinion that any publication
now existing can be superseded by
publication in a gazette without injury to
the public service.</p>

<p>Opinion among officials as to a gazette is
radically divided, the number for and
against appearing to be about equal,
though the adverse argument appears to
be the stronger. Opinion in the committee
is also widely divided, and we are unable
to make a unanimous recommendation on
the desirability or feasibility of issuing a
gazette on the model of the London
Gazette or of any other official gazette
known to us.</p>

<p>Your committee, however, thinks it a
duty to submit for consideration an alternative
plan, based on a suggestion offered
in one of the official letters received in
reply to its inquiries. This alternative is
an executive gazette, to contain all of the
official papers and messages of the President
and such other occasional matters of
special and immediate importance as the
President may think it advisable to have
officially published. Such matter might
perhaps at times be drawn from the diplomatic
correspondence with other governments
or from reports made by American
ambassadors, ministers, or consuls, or
from the findings or rulings of commissions
or other official bodies or other
sources for which no special method of official
publication is now provided.</p>

<p>The weight of this suggestion lies in the
fact that every word officially put forth by
the chief executive is of universal interest
and of historical import, and no official vehicle
for its complete and authentic publication
is now provided. It is printed in the
Congressional Record, in the newspapers,
on separate sheets, in the collected volumes
of statutes, and sometimes not at all.
These publications are so scattered and
each different kind so incomplete that the
most industrious librarian or other collector
can never be sure that he has all.
When the congressional compilation of the
messages and papers of the Presidents
from Washington to McKinley was made
the originals were gathered from all sorts
of public documents and old newspaper
files and miscellaneous sources. When it
chanced that some of the old papers were
preserved in public offices the compilers&mdash;especially
at first&mdash;did not know where to
look for them. That compilation as finally
made is commendable, but nobody can say
that it is complete. It served, however, to
demonstrate&mdash;what indeed all students
knew before&mdash;that there is no place where
all the official utterances of the head of
the government may certainly be found.
If they were all to be printed in one publication&mdash;if
the faith of all Presidents were
pledged that all official papers should be
given publicity in one known publication,
and if that publication were so published
by volume and number that any historical
student or collector might know to a certainty
when he had secured all of these
publications, then it seems to your committee
that something of real moment
would have been accomplished.</p>

<p>It is true that the publication of presidential
messages in an executive gazette
would contradict the unanimous opinion of
the committee that any sort of an official
gazette should be wholly colorless from a
partisan point of view. Still, it seems of
high state importance that all of the official
utterances of the chief executive,
without exception, should be collected and
published in some known and accessible
place. Whether this consideration is of
more or less importance than that of keeping
a gazette free from partisanship the
committee does not undertake to decide. It
submits the suggestion without expression
of opinion on its own part.</p>

<h2>AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF LAW LIBRARIES</h2>


<h3>FIRST SESSION<br />

(June 24, 1913, at 8:30 p. m., at the Hotel
Kaaterskill.)</h3>


<p>The meeting was called to order by President
Poole, twenty-eight members being
present.</p>

<p>The address of welcome, which was to
have been delivered by Mr. Frank B. Gilbert,
of the Department of Education of
New York State, was given in the form of a
telegram from him, as he was unavoidably
prevented from attending.</p>

<p>President Poole addressed the association
as follows:</p>

<p>This is the eighth annual meeting of
this Association. We had hoped to have
with us Mr. Frank B. Gilbert, who is one
of the charter members, formerly of the
New York State Law library, but this
morning I received the following telegram:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Unable to be present tomorrow night.
Unexpected official business requires attention
tomorrow afternoon. Hope your meeting
will be successful."</p></div>

<p>I think we will have to take the welcome
from the last six words.</p>

<p>The next item on the program is the
President's address. I am not going to
make any address because you would not
be edified.</p>

<p>I would call your attention, however,
to a few things which have appealed to me
during the past year, and which, with suggestions
which will come from the members
present, will make perhaps a basis for
our work during the coming year.</p>

<p>In my library, and I have no doubt in a
good many of the libraries represented
here, there have been calls for practice
and form books, and perhaps for other
local books of states outside of one's own
state, and you have all probably experienced
difficulty in getting proper information
regarding such material. This need
is coincident with the possibility of developing
our Law Library Journal. It occurs
to me that we might organize a committee
to publish in our Law Library Journal,
once a year, a list of local practice and
form books, giving the title, author, number
of the edition, date of publication, cost
and publisher&mdash;the idea being to include
in the list, not all the books, but the best
books, and to place the choosing of that
list in the hands of parties familiar with
such books. If a list could be published
every year it would be of considerable
advantage.</p>

<p>Another suggestion has come to me&mdash;I
think from Mr. Hewitt&mdash;that we put in the
Law Library Journal, in some such way
as described above, references to the court
rules of the highest courts of the several
states and any important local courts that
are represented in the published reports.
I do not refer to the text of the rules and
the many amendments, but where they can
be found, date of adoption, etc.</p>

<p>There is another matter which will come
up at one of the sessions, viz., the movement
for uniformity in the publication of
session laws. You will hear more about
that later, but it is worth our consideration.
You all know the rather baffling
way in which session laws are published;
hardly any two states are alike, and the
states change their methods from year to</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>
<p>year, causing a great deal of confusion and
difficulty in finding material.</p>

<p>You are perfectly familiar with the chief
work which this Association has accomplished,
viz., the publication of the Index
to Legal Periodicals and Law Library Journal.
We can congratulate ourselves, I
think, on a fairly successful year. The
editorial work has been done very well,
and the promptness of publication has
shown some improvement. Mechanically,
we have it on a better basis than ever before,
and there is no reason why the publication
should not continue and become
actually self-supporting. Now, as you
know, it only partially pays for itself. The
Association pays a certain amount of the
costs. We hope to increase the subscriptions
among practicing lawyers, and plans
have already been made for doing this.</p>

<p>We should, I think, take more pains with
the Law Journal portion. We have not
done with that all that is possible. Personally
I think that the editor, working as
he does at present&mdash;I mean by that, under
his present contract and with the time at
his disposal&mdash;can hardly be expected to do
very much more; but we can make a good
deal more out of the publication if we improve
the Law Journal&mdash;make it more
readable, so that people will subscribe for
the Journal alone. I do not think you can
say that anyone would pay $5 a year
for what is in the Law Journal now. I
wish that matter could be taken up later
and discussed, and that steps might be
taken to bring about an improvement in
that respect.</p>

<p>The report of the Treasurer was read
by Mr. Redstone of the Social Law library
in Boston.</p>

<p>Under the head of the Report of the Executive
Committee, the letter from Chairman
C. W. Andrews, of the special committee
on the relations between the American
Library Association and affiliated societies,
was considered.</p>

<p>Reports of the special committees were
made by Mr. A. J. Small, of the Iowa State
Law library, chairman of the committee on
legal bibliography; by Dr. G. E. Wire, of
the Worcester County (Mass.) law library,
chairman of the committee on reprinting
session laws; by Mr. O. J. Field,
of the Department of Justice, chairman of
the committee on Latin-American laws.</p>

<p>The first Round Table was held on
Wednesday, June 25, 1913, at 9:30 a. m.</p>

<p>The report of the committee to confer
with the Library of Congress on subject
headings was given by Mr. Hewitt of Philadelphia,
and a discussion ensued. This was
followed by a symposium on architectural
plans and furnishings for law libraries, participated
in by Mr. Frederick D. Colson,
of the New York State law library, Mr.
Godard, Mr. Poole, Mr. Hicks, Mr. Schenk
and Mr. Hewitt.</p>

<p>At the second session, Wednesday, June
25th, at 2:30 p. m., Mr. Colson gave an
account of the destruction and rebuilding
of the New York State library. Mr. Frederick
C. Hicks, of the Columbia University
library, read a paper on "Law libraries and
the public," which was followed by a statement
by Dr. Wire on the Massachusetts
system of county law libraries.</p>

<p>A paper on the work in the University of
Minnesota law library, by Mr. Arthur C.
Pulling, librarian, will be printed in a future
issue of the Journal, Mr. Pulling being
unable to attend.</p>

<p>The nominating and auditing committees
were appointed by President Poole, as
follows:</p>

<p>Nominating Committee: George S. Godard,
chairman; Mrs. M. C. Klingelsmith, E.
J. Lien.</p>

<p>Auditing Committee: O. J. Field, chairman;
William R. Reinick, Mary V. Fisk.</p>

<p>The vouchers, etc., sent by Mr. Whitney,
not having arrived owing to the delay of
the express company, the auditing committee
were instructed to report to the executive
committee as soon as the material
could be examined.</p>

<p>The committee on resolutions, consisting
of Mr. A. J. Small, Mrs. Klingelsmith and
Mrs. Hoover, reported the following resolution
on the death of Charles J. Babbitt,
which was ordered spread upon the minutes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"WHEREAS, after a long and untiring
service in his life work our friend and
fellow member Charles J. Babbitt has this

<h2>LEAGUE OF LIBRARY COMMISSIONS<br />

Tenth annual meeting at Kaaterskill, N. Y., June 25-27, 1913</h2>


<h3>FIRST SESSION<br />

(Wednesday, June 25, 2:30 p. m.)</h3>


<h3>Round Table on Organizing Small
Libraries</h3>

<p>The meeting was called to order by the
President, Mr. Milam. A roll-call by states
showed that sixteen were represented: Indiana,
Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
New Jersey, New York, North Dakota,
Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont
and Wisconsin. The President then
introduced the leader of the discussion,
Miss Zaidee Brown, of Massachusetts. The
outline of the discussion, as printed on the
program, was as follows:</p>

<p>

<br />
6. Board meeting: Budget and other administrative<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">problems</span><br />
</p>

<p>It was stated that for this discussion
"small library" meant any library with less
than 5,000 volumes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As to the accession book, the general
opinion seemed to be that there was more
reason for keeping it in a library without
trained service than in a larger one, and
that the trustees usually liked to have it
kept. A very simple entry was recommended.
Miss Brown suggested that where,
in reorganizing, it was necessary to accession
the books already in the library, the
quickest way was to number them when
the first, or shelf-list, card was written.
These cards might be kept in numerical
order, and the accession book written from
them, thus saving one handling of the
books. She said one reason for keeping
an accession book in a small library is
that the accession number may be used for
charging; this led to a discussion of the
use of Cutter numbers in a small library;
Miss Wright, of Vermont, uses them and
has found no trouble. Miss Brown thinks
they add considerably to the labor and expense
of reorganizing, and she has found
them likely to fall into confusion with untrained
librarians. No conclusion was
reached.</p>

<p>As to classification, the preference was
for a simplified form of the D. C., using
only three figures in most cases, and combining
some classes.</p>

<p>The leader then asked how many organizers
favored a dictionary catalog, with an
untrained librarian. Miss Hazeltine, of
Wisconsin, said that in that state they
start only a shelf-list, to be used as a
classed catalog, until the librarian can
attend summer school, and then a dictionary
catalog is made. Miss Askew stated
that in New Jersey a dictionary catalog is
made even for a small library, if the librarian
and trustees wish it. In Vermont, also,
the organizer starts a dictionary catalog.</p>

<p>Miss Frances Hobart, librarian at Vergennes,
Vt., reported that when she classified
she placed a slip in the book giving
the class and book number, and the subject
headings to be used, for the guidance
of the cataloger. These slips are kept, to
form a rough shelf-list, and serve the purpose
in assigning Cutter numbers. A number
of those present said that they thought
it not necessary to make a shelf-list simply
for taking an inventory, as many libraries
do not take inventory, and it is not worth
the labor of the shelf-list. Mr. Olin Davis,
librarian at Laconia, N. H., described a
method of taking inventory from the accession
book, thus making a shelf-list for
that purpose unnecessary. The discussion
showed that in some states the custom of
the state organizer is to start a dictionary
catalog, and to make a shelf-list only if
Cutter numbers are used, or if the additional
labor can be easily afforded. Miss Brown,
of Massachusetts, said that she preferred,
with an untrained librarian, to make an
author and title catalog, and to use the
shelf-list for a subject catalog. She makes
an alphabetic index to the shelf-list, which
also serves as a guide for classification,
and includes in this index analyticals and
secondary subject cards. She feels that
this method reduces to a minimum the
difficulty of assigning subject headings,
and the danger of scattering material
through doing this poorly. The objection
to her method was made that such a catalog
is not so easy for the public to use;
she admitted this, but said that in a small
library the catalog is mainly a tool for the
librarian. Mrs. Budlong, of North Dakota,
recommended using the order card for the
shelf-list.</p>

<p>The discussion showed that in New Jersey
and Vermont the organizer usually
starts a dictionary catalog; and in Minnesota,
Indiana, Wisconsin and Massachusetts
the shelf-list is used as a subject catalog
unless the librarian has at least summer
school training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the use of Library of Congress
cards, the general testimony seemed to be
that the labor of ordering them, and adding
numbers and headings, is about equal
to that of making simple cards, with a
typewriter. Miss Brown stated that the
added expense for cards per 1,000 volumes
is about $35, if the order is by author and
title. Miss Farr, of Maryland, said that
she could catalog about 1,000 volumes a
month, making a dictionary catalog, if she
made her own cards, and about 1,100 if she
used Library of Congress cards&mdash;showing
that the labor is nearly the same.</p>

<p>It was not possible to give definite estimates
of the cost of reorganization or the
time required, as conditions vary so greatly;
but some general averages were obtained.
Mr. Milam, of Indiana, stated that
the cost of supplies and labor, including
the time and expenses of the state organizer,
was about $50 to $60 per 1,000 volumes.
One organizer said that a cataloger
should average 40 volumes a day, assigning
Cutter numbers and making a dictionary
catalog. Miss Askew, of New Jersey,
thought this number too small, and said
she expected one person to make a dictionary
catalog for 1,000 volumes in two
weeks. Miss Brown, of Massachusetts,
said that the number of volumes done in a
week varied from 500 to 1,000 volumes,
according to the amount of local help received.
She finds it possible to get volunteer
workers for a good deal of the work,
including writing the cards, and doing the
mechanical work involved by a new charging
system. This estimate is not for a dictionary
catalog, but for an author and title
list, and a shelf-list for non-fiction with
subject index&mdash;no imprint being given on
most of the cards. To show the cost of
reorganization where there was practically
no volunteer labor, Miss Brown gave the
figures for a library at West Bridgewater,
Mass., which contained about 6,500 volumes.
The state library commission gave
about a week of Miss Brown's time, which
is not included in the estimate, a cataloger
was engaged at $75 a month, and an
assistant at $50. Local workers were paid
about twelve cents an hour. The books
were accessioned, classified, an author and
title catalog made, and a shelf-list for non-fiction
with subject index. Book-pockets
and book-cards were placed in the books.
Copy for a printed catalog was made. This
catalog was later printed, at a cost of
about $125. The entire cost of the work,
including printing the catalog, was between
$600 and $700, or about ten cents
per volume. The time required was about
seven weeks.</p>

<p>As to the question of how the organizer
might interest the people of the town,
there was a discussion on whether the organizer
did better work if she stayed at
the hotel, or was entertained in a private
family. She can, of course, become better
acquainted if in a family, but Mr. Milam
said that he thought the hotel preferable
because there would be no drain on her
vitality outside library hours. It developed
during the discussion that in several states
the commission pays the living expenses of
the organizer in the town. In Massachusetts,
the library is expected to meet this
expense, but the state sometimes helps
buy the supplies.</p>

<p>As to the meeting of the Board, Mr.
Milam said that he thought the organizer
should always meet the Board, and if possible
leave with them a suggested budget
for a library of that size. Miss Brown said
that she carried with her sample copies of
a number of selected lists and library aids,
and showed them to the Board of Trustees.</p>

<p>A number of organizers spoke of addressing
clubs, schools, and other bodies
in connection with the work.</p>

<p>After the Round Table, Mr. Milam appointed
the following nominating committee:
Miss Clara Baldwin, chairman; Mrs.
Percival Sneed, Miss Zaidee Brown. The
meeting then adjourned.</p>


<h3>SECOND SESSION<br />

(Wednesday, June 25th, 8:30 p. m.)</h3>

<p>The topic of the second session was libraries
in state institutions and in federal
prisons. Mr. Milam, the president, called
the meeting to order. Miss Julia A. Robin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>son,
supervising librarian of the state institutions
of Iowa, opened the discussion.
Mr. Jenkins, of New York, who was announced
on the program, was unable to be
present. Miss Robinson spoke first of the
need of providing good reading matter in
state institutions; and pointed out that
such libraries have the advantage of those
in the outside world, in that they need not
compete with so many conflicting interests
in their patrons. Of the two possible kinds
of supervision; by an outside authority,
such as a state library commission, or by
an official of the board controlling the
state institutions, the latter is preferable
if the appointment of such an official is not
dominated by politics. An official appointed
by the Board of Control has greater
authority, can maintain a closer supervision
of the books admitted, and can obtain
more help from the inmates of the institutions.
As to methods employed, the book
selection should be carefully made to suit
the various classes in the different institutions;
and the organization should be as
simple as possible. In Iowa, they use an
accession book, the decimal classification,
and a simple form of shelf-list. In all the
institutions, reading rooms for the use of
the inmates under proper supervision add
to the usefulness of the libraries.
The librarian is usually an officer or
employee of the institution, but should
possess a knowledge of the books in her
own library, and a sympathetic acquaintance
with the inmates which will enable
her to assist them in selecting the books
which will be most helpful to them. She
should also have sufficient time to give
proper attention to the library. Inmates
often make good assistants, but should
work under close supervision and should
not be allowed to select the books. In the
prisons, where the readers do not have
access to the shelves, printed finding lists
are necessary.</p>

<p>Miss Florence R. Curtis, of the University
of Illinois Library School, next spoke
on libraries in prisons. She called attention
to the fact that nearly eighty per cent
of those in prisons will be out of prison in
from one to ten years. They should be
regarded as citizens in the making, to be
helped in every way possible. Of those
who enter, about ninety per cent are literate;
and over seventy-five per cent have
attended school beyond the sixth grade.
About fifty per cent of those sent to prison
are so-called "accidental criminals," that
is, they have yielded to an impulse, but are
not habitually criminal. Before they leave
prison, however, they have received an
education of a sort in crime. They know
the criminal class, its leading men, etc.,
they know the methods of crime, and they
have learned to regard the law as more
favorable to the rich than to the poor, and
how best to evade it. Besides this, they
have become acquainted with unclean literature,
circulated secretly; and with vice
and dissipation. Guards in the prison often
peddle drink and drugs to the prisoners.
As to what they have learned that is
good, she enumerated the following: The
prisoner may have learned a trade, but the
trades taught often do not help in earning
a living outside. The prisoner may have
attended a school. Usually the school is
held for four months, is taught by a volunteer
prisoner, and aims only to teach the
elementary subjects. The prisoner has attended
the church service. Last, the prisoner
may have had the use of the prison
library. Miss Curtis examined the catalogs
of thirty prisons. Perhaps three-fourths
of the books might be regarded as deadwood.
Often the libraries contain vicious
books, which give wrong ideas of the relations
of men and women, and of the family;
create a false idea of life; and make
dissipation attractive. The works of Chambers,
Elinor Glyn, Phillips, Mrs. Southworth,
and others of similar grade, are
found in large numbers in the prison libraries.
The prisoner has so much time
to think over what he reads, that especial
care should be taken that his reading
should be wholesome. Books dealing with
shady business methods, religious unrest,
race prejudice, the detection of crime, etc.,
are all bad. All fiction added to the library
should first be read by a person of good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
judgment, with respect to its effect on the
prisoners. The selection of suitable books
does not represent the whole duty toward
the prisoner. Personal guidance in the
choice of books is most desirable. The
chaplain is not always the best person to
give such guidance as he may not be familiar
with modern fiction and he has other
duties. The superintendent is not always
interested in the reading of the prisoners.
The superintendent of a reform school stated
flatly that the physical care of the girls
was the main duty and interest of the institution.
A librarian appointed by the
Board of Control will make the most careful
selection of the books. The librarian
should also visit the institutions and give
as much personal guidance to the reading
as possible. It should be noted, however,
that this is not a place for an immature
person, nor a sentimental one.</p>

<p>Miss Curtis said that the duty of the
state library commission, as to prison
libraries, was to try to rouse the superintendents,
and bring about a better condition.</p>

<p>Miss Stearns, of Wisconsin, asked about
the use of magazines in prisons. She had
visited a prison, with the chaplain acting
as librarian, where they took dozens of
magazines, and had given up buying books
because the magazines were so popular.
Among those especially in demand were
World's Work, Current Events, and Cosmopolitan.
Miss Robinson, of Iowa, said
that they took magazines for the prisons,
but in no case were magazines bought to
the exclusion of all books. Where it is
regarded as necessary, the magazines are
expurgated by clipping out certain articles.
Miss Curtis said that in Illinois prisons
many magazines are taken, and are very
popular. The men are allowed to form
magazine clubs, and to take any magazine
not positively disreputable; and many of
the cheaper lower-grade magazines are
taken.</p>

<p>Miss Clarke, librarian of the public library
at Auburn, N. Y., where there is a
state prison, said that she had investigated
prison libraries in New York state, especially
in Auburn, in connection with the
work of a committee of the New York
State Library Association. She regards
conditions in New York state as discouraging.
In Auburn, the selection is not so bad,
but the men are allowed little if any selection.
A convict assistant chooses fifty
volumes for fifty cells. These are passed
out, and each one is kept a week. It is
then passed on to the next cell. An educated
ex-convict in a letter printed by Richard
Harding Davis in the New York Sun,
stated that he was unable for a year to
get a book he wanted, though nobody else
wanted it. They have no printed catalogs
or lists. In the women's prison, in Auburn,
the prisoners are allowed to select books,
and one of the teachers had done some
work with reading clubs. Miss Clarke
stated that in New York state prisons, the
teacher of the prison school is not a convict.
The prison school is allowed $50
worth of books a year. The hope for improvement
in New York state, in library
conditions in the prisons, is through the
appointment of a librarian in each prison,
or a library supervisor of all state penal
institutions.</p>

<p>Mr. Wellman, of Springfield, Mass., asked
how to rouse interest in prison libraries in
a state where there is no interest. Miss
Curtis said that one should avoid rousing
general public criticism, as this would antagonize
the prison authorities; that it was
better to use the slow method of getting
the heads of the institutions and the board
controlling the prisons interested. The
state library commission should do this.
A general article in the press on the value
of good prison libraries might be desirable,
but one should by all means avoid anything
approaching a sensational story about
special cases. As an example of how to
rouse interest, Mr. Wynkoop spoke of the
number of New York Libraries, published
in February, 1913, which was devoted
largely to libraries in state institutions.
Copies of this were sent to all trustees of
state institutions in New York state, to
members of legislative committees dealing
with charitable and reformatory institu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>tions,
to members of sociological societies,
to mayors and sheriffs, to most of the
leading newspapers of the state, and to
others of influence. About 700 copies were
sent out in this way. There have been
some evident results. In Syracuse, Rochester,
Bath, Jamestown, and some other
places, the papers have had notices about
the need of better libraries in prisons and
jails, and the authorities have in some
cases taken steps to improve conditions.
In answer to questions, Mr. Wynkoop said
that he did not make direct criticism of
the present library conditions in prisons,
but spoke of the poor economy of spending
so little on them. The maximum amount
spent on the library of any institution in
New York state is $500, though expenditures
for other purposes may run into the
millions.</p>

<p>It was suggested that public libraries
should supply local jails with reading matter.
Miss Clarke stated that in the state
prison at Auburn, magazines are taken
for the officials, but are not loaned to the
prisoners. An offer of discarded but usable
books from the public library to the
jail was refused, because the prisoners
would cut out the pictures and put them on
the wall.</p>

<p>Miss Charlotte Templeton, secretary of
the Nebraska public library commission,
next spoke on libraries in reformatories.
This is a somewhat more hopeful group
than the prisons. The inmates are often
below the average physically, somewhat
bitter, and frightened, and sobered by
their first contact with the law. The reformatory
must build them up; physically,
mentally, and in the power of self-support.
In this the library is a valuable adjunct.
It should contain simple books on civics,
books to help the foreigner learn English,
and books on the technical subjects taught
in the prison. There is also a use for
books as a means of recreation. These
may put the inmate in a better attitude
toward life, and may be the entering wedge
for more serious reading. They should,
therefore, be the first line of attack. Again,
a prisoner may accept moral training from
a book that he would not from a person.
The books on conduct are much read.
Jordan's "Self-control," Grenfell's "Men's
helpers," and some of the new thought
books are much read. One prisoner said,
"If I had had that book three years ago
I should not be here now." Magazines are
generally taken, but as a supplement to
the collection of books. They include many
on current events and on technical work,
and some that are taken mainly for their
pictures. Country Life and Baseball
are very popular. In conclusion, Miss
Templeton said that the reformatory library
is much like a public library, and
should be administered in a similar way.
In this way, the inmates would become
familiar with the use of such a library,
would form the "library habit," and be
more likely to feel at home in the public
library on their release.</p>

<p>Miss EDITH KATHLEEN JONES, librarian
at McLean Hospital, Waverley, Mass.,
then read the following paper:</p>


<h3>SOME PROBLEMS OF THE INSTITUTION
LIBRARY ORGANIZER IN
THE STATE HOSPITALS</h3>

<p>Last year I had the pleasure of telling
you something of library work in one of
the large private hospitals for the insane;
this year I want to speak of some of the
problems the institution organizer will
meet when she undertakes to set in order
the libraries of the state hospitals.</p>

<p>In the first place, unless she is fortunate
enough to be appointed by the State Board
of Control or State Board of Insanity or
their equivalent, she may at times feel
that she is looked upon a little bit as an
outsider by the hospital staff, as one who
does not understand hospital conditions
and who belongs to an entirely different
order of things. She may even meet what
seems to her indifference or actual antagonism
on the part of a few superintendents.</p>

<p>The fact is, the library to librarians is
of supreme importance, but the library
to the average hospital superintendent is
merely one method of providing entertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>ment
or employment for his patients. He
is much more interested in the new social
service movement and the study of eugenics
and heredity than he is in the general
library, which, to his mind, is simply a
part of the therapeutic system and even
as such ranks far below useful employment
and arts and crafts work.</p>

<p>This indifference or antagonism does not
arise from any personal feeling nor is it
confined to the library. It is the natural
outcome of the peculiar organization demanded
in a hospital for the insane, a
general distrust of any outside interference
in any department, and a thorough conviction
that each hospital is entirely competent
to manage its own affairs. In one
state the state board refused the offer of
the state library committee to organize
its institution libraries for these very reasons.
In another state, where the possibility
of the state board appointing an
institution librarian of its own is under
discussion, one superintendent remarked
that he "could only say this; if it must
come he was thankful it was coming from
the <b>inside</b>, through the board and from one
who knew hospital conditions."</p>

<p>Another reason for this seeming indifference
on the part of the superintendents
is that, in the East at any rate, a state
hospital is <b>always</b> poor. It is poor and it
is crowded, and its superintendent is harrassed
with having his requests for better
accommodations for his patients, a new
power house, larger kitchens and laundries,
or quarters for his married men nurses
turned down; with trying to get larger appropriations
from the state legislature;
with endeavoring to feed and clothe and
house 1,200 patients on an appropriation
and in quarters designed for 1,000 at the
most. He probably has cut down his expenses
in every conceivable direction, and
he can not see the use of spending money
for books which the majority of his patients
will not read. And there is this to
be said for his point of view, that while
there are many educated and cultivated
persons in all the state hospitals, the majority
of them are foreigners and illiterates
from the mill and factory-hand classes and
from the slums of the cities. In New York
state alone, in 1906, forty-six per cent of
the whole number of patients admitted to
the New York hospitals were of foreign
birth. And I might add, to show the
menace of the class of people we are letting
into our country, that forty-six per
cent of the insane were aliens, while only
twenty-six per cent of the whole population
of the state were of foreign birth. Add
to these the outcasts from the slums and
you have a good idea of the make-up of
the state hospitals and asylums, and you
will not wonder that many superintendents
shake their heads when libraries are mentioned.</p>

<p>It would, therefore, seem to be one of the
duties of the organizer to prove to the
superintendent that even if three-fifths of
his patients are illiterate, reading should
be provided for the educated two-fifths;
that she, from her knowledge of books and
editions, can provide a thoroughly readable
library which will meet the requirements
of all classes, from college professors to
the dregs of humanity, for a much less
sum than he can do it, and from her
experience she can interest the patients in
books. For after you have the library, you
still have a set of people to deal with
who lack initiative and must be aroused
to interest in anything. She must also
impress upon him that shelf-and-book or
even accession numbers mean nothing, and
that when, as in one library I know, all
the books are covered and there is no hint
of author or title on the back, the library
is converted into a sort of literary grab-bag
which is funny to the librarian but exasperating
to the patient. She must convince
him that an unclassified library represents
a tremendous waste, especially
when it is not supplemented by a subject
catalog. She must be able to prove to
him from the experience of other hospitals
that the old-fashioned method of letting a
library run itself is not conducive to
growth and that there must be some one
whose chief duties are to the library. She
can assure him from figures that he is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
getting out of his library what he should,
if out of 1,000 patients only 60 use the
library during the year and 50 books a
week is a large circulation. She can tell
him of one hospital of 220 patients which
has from 75 to 100 regular readers, not
counting nurses and employees, and averages
25 books a day, or 8,900 a year; of another
of about the same size which often
gives out 50 books a day; of a third, which,
with a population of 2,000 gave out last
year 15,862 volumes to 344 persons. She
can guarantee him that if he will let her
weed out obsolete stuff and fill in with the
sort of books the patients want and train
some patient, nurse or stenographer to act
as librarian in her absence at other hospitals,
his library circulation will be doubled
or trebled the first year.</p>

<p>Having convinced the superintendent of
the utility of the organized, central library,
the institution librarian is now free to
turn her attention to the patients, getting
acquainted with them, learning their tastes
in books, interesting them in reading and
in pictures. And just here I would say
that in the state hospitals the doctors are
always glad to have anything new suggested
in the way of employment, and that if
the organizer can manage it so that the
patients can help her in the care of the
charging-system, mending and cataloging,
her efforts will be much appreciated by all
concerned.</p>

<p>The institution organizer will soon find
that each hospital differs from every other
in construction, management, and especially
in the character of illness. The asylums
for the chronic insane present the most
hopeless feature, yet even here there are
enough who read to make it worth while
to furnish libraries. Moreover, in the asylums,
the nurses have to be taken into
account. Their work is so hopeless and
uninteresting compared with that in hospitals
for acute and recoverable cases that
more must be done for them in order to
get and keep even ordinarily good attendants.
And where, as in many cases, the
chronic insane are being transferred to
farm colonies way out in the country, far
from any city or even large town, the library
can, if it will, help very decidedly by
offering means of study and education to
the nurses and staff as well as diversion
to the patients. Therefore, one can venture
to buy for an asylum a much better
selection of books from the point of view
of general culture than for the ordinary
hospital.</p>

<p>I have said so often that a hospital library
must be formed for entertainment,
not for education, that it must be simple in
organization and carried along on unconventional
lines, that I speak of these points
again only to emphasize them. If one
looks upon institutional work from the
point of view of educative influence it is
discouraging work; but if one thinks of
it as an adjunct to the therapeutic service
of the hospital, as a means of bringing
some pleasure or at least forgetfulness of
self for a time to an afflicted class and employment
for hours which otherwise would
be passed in complete idleness and utter
dejection, it is inspiring work. But in the
selection of books this point of view must
be kept always in mind.</p>

<p>Yet this is just what those unaccustomed
to hospital conditions fail to grasp. Not
three months ago a hospital in a far-off
western city sent a representative to see
our library and get all the information he
could in regard to the sort of books they
should put into their beautiful and expensive
new buildings. I showed him a list
of some 1,200 of our most popular books
selected as a basis for the little catalog
Miss Carey, Miss Robinson, Miss Waugh
and I have made out and annotated, and
which is now being printed by the A. L. A.
Publishing Board. The first thing he
noticed was the omissions. "Why," said
he, looking at Science, "you have nothing
by Spencer, or Darwin or Huxley on this
list. Aren't they the standard thing?
Oughtn't I to get them for our library?"
"Not if you want a library which will be
read," was my prompt reply, and I showed
him the records of our sets of these scientists,
taken out at the most three or four
times in the history of the library.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span></p>

<p>A year or so ago I attempted to find out
from our cards just what was the most
popular sort of fiction in our library. Of
course the book of the moment is the one
read at the moment, so it would be manifestly
unfair to include these and I took
only those books published prior to 1901.
It may interest you to know in their order
the 25 most read books, that is, of the old
favorites. The date unfortunately excludes
Mr. Pratt, the Virginian, Kim, Rex Beach
and Oppenheim. They are, The Choir Invisible,
Janice Meredith, Saracinesca, Sant'
Ilario, Don Orsino, Vanity Fair, The Lilac
Sunbonnet, Old Chester Tales, Dr. Lavender's
People, When Knighthood was in
Flower, The Sowers&mdash;taken out 20 times
in the last three years; The Seats of the
Mighty, The Battle of the Strong, Adventures
of Sherlock Holmes, Memoirs of Sherlock
Holmes, Treasure Island, Cape Cod
Folks and The Right of Way, 22 times;
A Little Moorland Princess, Dorothy Vernon,
Kidnapped and The Cardinal's Snuff
Box 25 times; Richard Carvel 29 times;
The Old Ma'amselle's Secret 40 times and
The Second Wife by Miss Marlitt 43 times.
This shows pretty conclusively that even
our people, all of whom belong to the cultivated
and educated class, want light, interesting
stories of romance and adventure,
and the average state hospital reader
wants something even lighter than these.</p>

<p>I have been asked again and again if
the right reading really cures. One dare
not affirm this; its influence is negative
rather than positive. But I <b>can</b> say this:
I have known of many cases outside as
well as in the hospital where persons have
been positively harmed by morbid or hysterically
sentimental books. Our people
are inclined to be pretty emotional anyway,
and whatever appeals to that side is to be
deplored.</p>

<p>To sum up the qualities which determine
the suitability of books for a hospital library,
I can do no better than quote from
the "Foreword" of the catalog mentioned
above:</p>

<p>In making this list the editors have endeavored
to keep in mind the following
points:</p>

<p>1. Books in a hospital are for recreation,
not for instruction, and therefore
should consist principally of fiction, picture
books, travel, biography, light and
popular science and outdoor books.</p>

<p>2. They must be wholesome&mdash;not morbid,
or gruesome, or depressing. Good detective
stories and tales of adventure, however
thrilling, if not horrible, and if they
do not make vice attractive, are to be recommended,
as they, more than almost anything
else, hold the attention.</p>

<p>3. Illustrated books and books of pictures
are invaluable, as a patient often will
look at pictures when he is too ill to read.</p>

<p>4. The newest fiction is called for and
read, yet the old favorites remain much
in demand. With so much ephemeral stuff
among the "best sellers," it is a delicate
task to select the really good novels which
will last, and there is a great temptation
to fall back on the old and tried books
to the exclusion of the more modern.
The editors have tried to combine the two
in just proportion, and also to give a few
titles of the better class of the "second
rate" which have proved popular.</p>

<p>5. It is not enough to provide books for
those who wish to read. There are always
many patients who are unable to take any
initiative towards selecting any form of
entertainment or employment for themselves,
and for these should be provided
light and simple stories which will not tax
the brain or require any concentration of
attention, but which will serve to stimulate
their interest in things outside themselves.
These are not necessarily children's books,
but often the simple language and quiet
wholesomeness of certain books for young
people will bridge a patient over this period
of mental inadequacy and pave the way towards
a real enjoyment of maturer reading.</p>

<p>In addition to these five simple rules for
selecting the reading for a hospital library,
the editors would emphasize another very
important point: Many of the readers will
be elderly persons with failing eyesight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
who demand large, clear type. This is
hard to procure in cheap editions of standard
authors and old favorites, but it is
suggested that it is well worth while to
take a little pains in selection and even
to pay a higher price, in order to get an
edition of convenient size, shape and
weight, in serviceable binding, with large,
clear type. Such an edition will last longer
and will invite, not repel the reader.</p>

<p>Complete sets of the works of standard
authors, with the exception of Shakespeare,
Scott, Dickens, and possibly George Eliot,
are not recommended for hospitals. Only
a few of the more popular stories of each
will be read.</p>

<p>I want to say just a word in regard to
the housing of hospital libraries. Of course
the ideal arrangement is a separate building
which is open all the time, but I know
of only three or four such in the country.
In most state hospitals the library was an
afterthought and the books are crowded
into one or two more or less inaccessible
rooms to which the patients can come only
once or twice a week and which can not
possibly be made attractive. Often there is
absolutely no other room to be had in the
hospital and the librarian must make the
most of it and do her utmost to beautify
it with rugs and baskets made by the patients
and flowers from the hospital greenhouses.
But sometimes a little ingenuity
will solve the problem in some such unique
way as in the State Infirmary at Tewksbury,
Mass., where the superintendent conceived
the idea of moving their very good
little library (classified and cataloged too)
from its one small dark, inaccessible room
in the administration house to the large,
light chapel which hitherto stood idle six
days in the week. Here low shelves have
been built in between the windows on the
wide side aisles and stacks fitted into the
alcove rooms each side the chancel. Long
narrow tables with plenty of books and
magazines have been placed in these aisles
and the library is now open practically all
the time.</p>

<p>The Hospital for Epileptics at Monson,
Mass., has met its problem somewhat differently.
The superintendent here is having
two large sunny rooms fitted up with
bookshelves, one for the men where they
can smoke and one for the women where
they can sew. These shelves will be kept
filled with books from the central library
(in an office in the administration house
which it shares with the medical library)
administered by the stenographer-librarian,
but under the direct supervision of a patient
for each room. The patients themselves
are very enthusiastic over the proposed
change and have made out lists of
books they want.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts, the ideal so far as use
of the library goes, is found at the Foxborough
Hospital for Inebriates, where
only men patients are admitted. Here they
have a separate building containing one
large room with low bookcases all around
it and two tables covered with periodicals
and newspapers in the center. Here the
men can come when their day's work is
over or at the noon hour and read and
smoke.</p>

<p>I wish I had time to speak of the importance
of interesting the nurses in the
library and getting their co-operation, and
of the possibility of holding classes on
books and reading for them. I know of no
hospital where they have time for such
classes at present, but there is a movement
on foot towards requiring better education
as a condition for entering the training
schools for the general hospitals, and
some day some hospital will inaugurate
classes in literature.</p>

<p>Miss Jones agreed with Miss Robinson's
statement that the libraries in state institutions
should be administered by an official
appointed by the Board of Control.</p>

<p>Miss Flexner, of the Louisville free public
library, then spoke of an experience in
placing books in a county jail. Within the
last six months, the public library offered
to place a deposit in the county jail, and
found that the jailer was willing. Permission
was also obtained from the Fiscal
Court. In November, about 100 volumes,
all fiction, were sent, to be retained four
months. On their return, it was found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
over 1,800 issues had been made&mdash;a heavy
circulation. In the next lot, was placed
about 15 per cent of non-fiction, carefully
selected. On their return, it was found
that books by Marden and Grenfell had
been popular. Mrs. Sangster's "Sweetest
story ever told," a life of Christ, had been
well used, while Mrs. Wharton's "House
of mirth" had been read but twice. "Rebecca
of Sunnybrook Farm," "Kim," and
Mrs. Whitney's "Ascutney street" were
each read 26 times in 6 weeks. Books on
useful arts were so much in demand that
they were renewed. The books are charged
by the chaplain. When a suspicious looking
gathering of the men was investigated
by the jailor, it was found that one who
could read was reading aloud to those who
could not.</p>

<p>In the discussion, it was stated that a
list of books for use in insane hospitals
is to be published soon and that copies
are to be on sale by the A. L. A. Publishing
Board. Several speakers mentioned a
union catalog for prison libraries, with
annotations to guide the prisoners in the
selection of books.</p>

<p>The committee on libraries in federal
prisons made a report, in which they stated
that an earnest attempt had been made
to secure an appropriation of at least $2,500
for the establishment of a library in the
penitentiary at Atlanta and a like amount
for Leavenworth, and $500 for books for
McNeil Island, but that the effort had been
unsuccessful. The attempt will be renewed
this coming year. The committee was
continued.</p>


<h3>THIRD SESSION<br />

(Friday, June 27, 1913; 8:30 p. m.)</h3>

<p>A third adjourned session of the League
was held for the transaction of remaining
business. The meeting was called to order
by the President.</p>

<p>Miss Martha Wilson, supervisor of school
libraries in Minnesota, spoke on co-operation
between library commissions and state
boards of education. Miss Mendenhall then
gave a summary of the work done by the
library committee of the N. E. A. on library
instruction in normal schools. She
stated that a questionnaire was sent to
200 normal schools, and the results show
that most of the normal school libraries
need reorganization. In the 200, about 50
have trained librarians. These are mainly
in the far West. The Committee makes
the following recommendations: 1, that
library organizations try to have the subject
of library training in normal schools
presented at educational meetings; 2, that
trained librarians be appointed in all normal
schools, with the faculty and salary
rank of heads of departments; 3, the publication
of a manual for normal school librarians
by the U. S. Bureau of Education;
4, the publication in educational periodicals
of articles on the greater use of
libraries by schools, and on related topics.
It was suggested that the library commissions
might help in carrying out the last
recommendation. Miss Mendenhall was
asked whether she favored putting the
school libraries under the state library
commissions, or under the state boards of
education. She said that she believed the
function of the school library to be distinct
from that of the public library; that the
two should co-operate but not combine.
Miss Stearns of Wisconsin said that the
question of the relation of the state library
commission to the state board of education
should be discussed and more clearly
defined; that there is a decided tendency
to place the library commission under the
state board of education, or to merge it
with it, as has already been done in one
state. There was not time for adequate
discussion of this subject, and the suggestion
was made that it be taken up at a future
League meeting.</p>

<p>Mrs. Minnie Clarke Budlong, director of
the North Dakota public library commission,
read the following report of the committee
on the establishment of new commissions:</p>


<h3>REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON ESTABLISHMENT
OF NEW COMMISSIONS</h3>

<p>This committee has been requested to
report on two topics&mdash;"a plan for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
League to follow in giving aid in the organization
of commissions in states now
without them," and also a draft of "tentative
provisions for a model library law to
be used with the model commission law."</p>

<p>An A. L. A. committee of which Dr. Arthur
E. Bostwick is chairman, has made
a valuable report on points to be covered
by a model law relating library to municipality,
printed in the 1912 proceedings. The
same committee has under consideration
the drafting of the points covered into a
model charter, and the League committee
decided that action on its own part was unnecessary
at present.</p>

<p>The other topic assigned this committee
cannot be disposed of in so brief a manner.
It is a question of theory and of insight,
of sympathetic understanding and action.</p>

<p>There are eleven states without library
commissions: West Virginia, South Carolina,
Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma,
New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Montana
and Wyoming. These states contain
one-eighth of the population of the country,
and have only one-twentieth of the
libraries.</p>

<p>The first step toward aid is to learn how
library commissions have been established
in other states. Letters sent to 36 states
elicited 22 replies. Perhaps a distinction
should be made between library commissions
and state libraries, or boards of
education, such as New York, California
and Oregon. But there have been included
in this report all states doing extension
work, regardless of name or title of organization.</p>

<p>The questions asked were:</p>

<p>1. How did the demand for a commission
arise?</p>

<p>The answers received are practically
unanimous. There was a need felt and provided
for by a few far-sighted library workers.
Eight give the credit of the initiative
to library workers or associations. Seven
give it to women's clubs or the state federation.
Five say librarians and women's
clubs were co-partners in the work, and
three, Maryland, Wisconsin and Nebraska,
include teachers in this partnership.</p>

<p>2. Who drew the law?</p>

<p>The law has usually been drawn by or
under the supervision of a few interested
workers, such as president of state library
association, superintendent of public instruction,
president of university, or legislative
committee of state federation. In
Kentucky use was made of the model commission
law.</p>

<p>3. What was done to secure its passage?</p>

<p>One would expect a wider range in replies
than this question elicited. "A
friendly legislator took it in charge" sums
up the story in most states. Personal letters
and interviews of library workers and
club women with members of the legislature,
and particularly with members of
committees, seem the usual methods. In
some states the measure was defeated one
or more times before influence enough was
brought to bear to secure its passage. In
Nebraska, the measure failed twice until
pushed by the federation and teachers.
Even if no general demand is formulated,
there must be a desire expressed by organizations
strong enough to impress legislators.</p>

<p>4. What literature was used?</p>

<p>At first, there was no literature available
and the majority report "none used" or
"nothing special." Idaho, Minnesota and
Kentucky mention the Wisconsin publications
particularly, also some from Iowa.
Five speak of special leaflets prepared or
statistics used from traveling library reports
or from the League Handbook.</p>

<p>5. How long did it take?</p>

<p>The time required varies from "a few
weeks" to fourteen years. Nine secured
the desired legislation in one session. Six
used two to four years. Nebraska required
five years; Minnesota, six years; Tennessee,
eight years, and Illinois, fourteen.</p>

<p>6. When was your law passed?</p>

<p>Massachusetts passed the first library
commission law in 1890. Since then similar
laws have been enacted in 36 states,
concluding with South Dakota and Arkansas
in 1913.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Has it been amended&mdash;if so, when
and how?</p>

<p>It is interesting to note how few amendments
except increase in appropriation
have been made in library laws. This emphasizes
the importance of careful framing
of the law in the beginning. A study
of the chief points of the law in other
states with such changes as will adapt
them to the conditions in the new state
should always be made.</p>

<p>Five states report no amendment. Two
report increase in membership of commission.
Ten report increase in appropriation,
or minor changes. Missouri and
North Dakota have had their annual appropriation
repealed on the theory that it
is not constitutional to bind succeeding
legislatures. Oregon has made the most
radical amendment, changing this year
from library commission to state library.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the matter seems to be
that the initiative is with a few interested
people, working through library associations,
women's clubs and teachers, on the
legislators, and that it may often be accomplished
in one session after public opinion
is sufficiently formed to bring the necessary
pressure to bear.</p>

<p>These summaries lead to the following
suggestions for aid:</p>

<p>1. A collection of material should be
made which would include all pamphlets
and articles on the practical establishment
of library commissions. Effort should be
made to include the special leaflets prepared
in each state during its campaign.
Some states, notably Kentucky, have prepared
maps for circulation to arouse interest.
A collection of all such special material
kept for loan would be found suggestive
and helpful in other states.</p>

<p>2. If possible some one should be sent
by the League as an organizer to assist
for a short time in the establishment of
new commissions. This organizer should
understand conditions in that section of
the country, and should be able to advise
wisely, talk with legislators persuasively,
and address library meetings and state
federations enthusiastically. Something
may be accomplished by correspondence
and by leaflets, but much more is possible
to the trained observer on the field. Conditions
even in neighboring states differ
widely, and require study on the field for
helpful understanding.</p>

<p>3. Special training for library commission
workers. There is need of electives
in the lines in which commission work differs
from public library work.</p>

<p>4. Discussion of practical questions at
League meetings. This is already being
done and should be continued so long as
there is need of a place where workers
may discuss their individual problems.</p>

<p>5. It is suggested a committee be appointed
to look after the needs of new
commissions after their organization, as
well as before the law is passed. There
are many problems arising at home and
abroad in which new workers would be
glad of assistance, were there some particular
committee to which they could apply.</p>

provisions:</p>


<h3>REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON CHARTER
PROVISIONS</h3>

<p>Since the meeting at Ottawa your committee
has somewhat awaited the action
of the council committee, which had been
working on the library law of the state
from the standpoint of its relation to the
free will and initiative of the municipality.
It was thought that the work of these committees
might duplicate each other. As
the report of this committee covering
statute law does not seem to meet the
point at issue, namely, safeguarding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
interests of the library under the adoption
of a new form of municipal government,
your committee would make two suggestions
concerning such safeguard:</p>

<p>1st. That it may be done by interesting
the legislation of the charter bill in a
definite provision establishing the public
library as a city department.</p>

<p>2nd. That it may be done by inserting
phrases in such bill, practically accepting
the existing state law.</p>

<p>In the first case the essential points
to be covered are: the provision of a proper
fund, the appointment of a competent
board. If all the duties of said board
are settled and all its powers defined, the
section will be a long and involved one.
Your committee therefore recommends
safeguarding the state library law as the
better plan.</p>

<p>To do this, care must be taken to insert
the proper phrases under sections which
(a) define the general duties of commissioners
wherever inclusive terms are used.
For instance, "and have power to administer
and control all other departments
or activities of said city," the clause "except
such as are already provided for in
the statutes" would guard the library law
existing; (b) under the rulings on civil
service, the same clause would be effective
in protecting library service, "except officers
whose appointment is already otherwise
provided for in the statutes"; (c)
under the section concerning establishment
and care of public institutions and buildings
the exception must be more definite,
e. g., "except that nothing in this law shall
be construed to affect the existing state
library law."</p>

<p>The chairman of your committee was not
successful in securing these amendments
to the commission government bill in Missouri,
but found the fathers of the bill willing
to consider them, and entirely ignorant
of any possible disturbance of the existing
library law under the new charter
provisions. Moreover, good lawyers claim
that a partially excepting phrase under
the general definition of powers in this
case makes it probable that no such disturbance
need result. This opinion can
not be confirmed, however, until a test
case gives us a Supreme Court decision.</p>

<p>Briefly, then, your committee recommends
protection on the charter law of
existing statutory provisions for libraries,
rather than a special charter provision.</p>

<h3>REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
LIBRARY POST</h3>

<p>The committee appointed by the League
to assist in obtaining favorable postal
rates for library books reports as follows:</p>

<p>As the members of the League are
aware, the provisions of the general parcel
post law were so changed immediately
before its enactment that printed matter
was excluded from the privileges of the
parcel post rates. Consequently the long-distance
lobbying which the committee and
the profession indulged in, favoring the
parcel post law, went for naught.</p>

<p>Since that time the committee has been
in correspondence with a number of members
of Congress favorable to the admission
of library books to parcel post rates.
During the winter the committee communicated
with all of the library commissions
and with many state and city
libraries asking their co-operation in interesting
their representatives in so
changing the law as to admit books. While
reports indicate that this co-operation was
furnished, and several Congressmen stand
ready to favor a change, the results have
been nil. This failure to get any results
whatsoever is partly due to the fact that
special legislation had entirely engaged
the attention of Congress.</p>

<p>The committee desires to call the attention
of the League to the fact that it is
not at all certain that to be included in
this original parcel post law would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
great assistance to the libraries in circulating
books. For practical library use
the changed rates would be of little or
no advantage, except for points within the
fifty mile zone. Take, for example, a
book weighing a trifle over one pound
(and this is a very ordinary-sized book).
It can be sent anywhere within the postal
union for nine cents under the present
third class rates. By parcel post rate
it would cost six cents to send this book
to a point in the city or along any rural
route centering in the city. It will cost
eight cents to send this book anywhere
within the fifty mile zone. Above the
fifty mile zone the parcel post rate will
exceed the third class rate as indicated
below.</p>


<ul><li>150 mile zone&mdash;ten cents&mdash;1 cent excess over existing 3rd class.</li>
<li>300 mile zone&mdash;twelve cents&mdash;3 cents excess over existing 3rd class.</li>
<li>600 mile zone&mdash;fourteen cents&mdash;5 cents excess over existing 3rd class.</li>
<li>1,000 mile zone&mdash;sixteen cents&mdash;7 cents excess over existing 3rd class.</li>
</ul>

<p>and so on, until it will cost twenty-four
cents to send the book more than 1,800
miles by parcel post as against the nine
cents under existing third class rates&mdash;an
excess of 15 cents.</p>

<p>These facts are the occasion for, and
justify the opposition which some publishing
houses and other commercial houses
sending out books or catalogs exhibited to
including printed matter within the parcel
post law. In some ways it would be
unfortunate at this time to admit books to
the parcel post rates, since accepting
these unsatisfactory rates might prevent
further re-adjustments for some time to
come. It might be wiser to make an effort
to get better rates.</p>

<p>It is the committee's judgment that there
is much in common between the library
authorities and some of the commercial
forces which opposed admitting printed
matter to the parcel post, that we have
all much in common.</p>

<p>It is therefore recommended that the
committee be directed to use every effort
to get into communication with the forces
which have opposed the admission of printed
matter to the parcel post rates in order
that these forces may be united with library
authorities in an effort so to adjust
rates as to be more advantageous to
all than the present parcel post rates
would be.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the committee reports
that it seems unlikely that any further
legislation will be immediately enacted.</p>

<p>The report was accepted, and the committee
continued and directed to carry out
the recommendation contained in the report.</p>

<p>The following reports of the publication
committee and the committee on study
outlines were read:</p>


<h3>REPORT OF PUBLICATION
COMMITTEE</h3>

<p>The publication committee of the League
respectfully reports:</p>

<p>That they have had under consideration
during the past year two publications,
neither of which the committee has found
necessary to publish, but both of which
are to be published elsewhere.</p>

<p>Application was made to the committee
for a new edition of Mrs. McDonald-Jones'
"Magazines for the small library."
At about the time this request was
received it was learned that Mr. F. K.
Walter had prepared a manuscript for
publication which was substantially such a
revision. The committee held a meeting
at the mid-winter meeting of the Western
Section of the League and recommended
to the A. L. A. Publishing Board that this
be published. We are informed that the
Publishing Board has issued this and that
it is now obtainable.</p>

<p>The committee has also had under consideration
during the year the publication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
of a "Reading list for the insane" prepared
with great care by Miss Miriam
E. Carey of the Minnesota public library
commission. The committee hesitated to
recommend the publication of this since
it seemed that the demand for it would
be so limited that it would be difficult
to obtain returns for the money expended.
The committee is informed, however, that
the list will be printed by the A. L. A.
Publishing Board and that suitable arrangements
for its distribution to libraries
will be made.</p>

<p>The committee reports that the committee
on study outlines, which was originally
a subcommittee of the publication
committee, has, as shown by their report
submitted herewith, arrived at a satisfactory
form of study-club outline.</p>

<p>It is therefore recommended that immediate
steps be taken to secure the preparation
of study outlines to be printed at
once. If no other procedure can be found
the committee suggests that after a list of
the most desirable subjects to be covered
is made up, a limited number of subjects
be assigned to each active commission,
with agreement on their part to prepare
at as early a date as possible suitable
outlines on these subjects, conforming
each as nearly as may be to the form
adopted by the League; that all these outlines
be submitted to some one person to
be edited in order to secure substantial
uniformity of form and to insure that the
outline will be useful in other states and
that the committee be authorized to secure
the immediate printing of these if
this can be done on a basis which is financially
sound.</p>

<p>Informal discussion of this plan with
several of the commissions indicates that
the work can be done in this way. It is
strongly urged that this work should be
inaugurated at once.</p>

<h3>REPORT OF THE STUDY OUTLINE
COMMITTEE</h3>

<p>Those who were in attendance at the
meeting of the League of Library Commissions
in Chicago in January, 1911, will
recall the general discussion of the need
of study outlines to be used in traveling
library work in connection with study
clubs, and that the publication committee
was asked to investigate and report as to
the feasibility of the League's undertaking
the preparation of such outlines, to
be utilized by the various traveling libraries.
Mr. M. S. Dudgeon, as Chairman, reported
progress at the Pasadena meeting
in May, 1911, and submitted suggestions
toward a uniform plan. Later Miss Margaret
W. Brown of Iowa, who had been active
in club work in her own state, as
Chairman of the Literature and Library
Extension Committee of the State Federation
of Women's Clubs, was made Chairman
of the special committee on study
outlines.</p>

<p>In view of the possibility of the various
library commissions contributing one or
more study outlines for League use, it
seemed important that a general scheme
for preparing these should be agreed upon,
and Miss Brown presented such a scheme
for discussion at the Chicago mid-winter
League meeting in January, 1912, relating
to the basis and form for preparing these
outlines, based on a single text with a
small group of collateral references. This
was worked out very carefully, and tested
by preparing a few outlines according to
the proposed scheme, which had proved
very acceptable; and it was suggested that
the various commissions use the plan in
preparing outlines, with the thought of securing
uniformity in preparation and printing.
The Chairman conferred with such
thorough students of literature as Mrs.
Francis Squire Potter and Mrs. H. A. Davidson,
both having practical experience in
study club work, the former being Chairman
of the Literature and Library Extension
Committee of the General Federation
of Woman's Clubs, and the latter well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
known as the editor of the Study Guide
series.</p>

<p>At the annual meeting of the League at
Ottawa in June, 1912, definite recommendations
were made to the League conforming
to the plan presented at the Chicago meeting
the January preceding, and the League
voted to authorize an expenditure not exceeding
$100 for the preparation and printing
of a few outlines. The scheme commended
itself to certain publishers to such
an extent that the League was assured
that there would be no financial risk in
having these printed, as it seemed reasonably
sure there would be a demand for
them not only on the part of traveling
library systems, but public libraries generally,
and the General Federation of
Women's Clubs and the various state federations.</p>

<p>These plans would doubtless have been
consummated before this, had not the
Chairman, Miss Brown, found it necessary
to give up her work on account of the
condition of her health, thus making it impossible
to pursue the matter further, involving
as it did many details and careful
editorial supervision of the material to be
put in print. Your present Acting Chairman
consented to carry on the work until the
time of this annual meeting, hoping to
carry out Miss Brown's plans as to printing
a few outlines, as a visible result of
the long period of investigation by the
committee; she regrets that many things
have conspired to make this impossible.
Hence, this report is made chiefly with the
desire of "keeping history straight" up to
this point, and transmitting to your next
committee a statement of progress up to
this time.</p>

<p>This report is made with the firm belief
that no more important project is under
consideration by the League than this, and
that if it is kept clearly in mind that
these outlines are to meet a real need of
a large class of intelligent, ambitious women
of this country who have not college
preparation, but are eager students, the
outlines will be utilized in a very resultful
way.</p>

<p>Before the Chicago meeting in January,
1913, a request was made by this committee
for a list of subjects for which study
outlines were most in demand by the various
state traveling libraries, and a summary
of the answers received showed an
increasing demand for aids in the study
of public questions rather than literary or
cultural subjects. Definite statements
were made by several library commissions
as to the need of outlines on civic
improvement for small towns, civics, conservation,
household economics, municipal
housekeeping, etc.</p>

<p>The plan submitted by Miss Brown as
Chairman of this committee as a part of
her report at the Ottawa meeting is attached
hereto.</p>

</p>

<p>Plan for Preparation of Study Outlines</p>

<p><i>Basis</i></p>

<p>A. One book selected as foundation for
Outline.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If a single book suitable for text can
not be found, outline to be based on
fewest number of books necessary for
the purpose.</p>

<p>Text selected to be authoritative, reasonable
in price, readable and stimulating.</p></div>

<p>B. Five to ten books as collateral reference.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Selected to cover subject matter in
study outline and amplify the text.</p>

<p>Publisher and price given for all books
included, for use in purchase.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Note</b>: A more extended list of books can
easily be prepared by any library where
additional material is available.</p></div>

<p>Lessons Should Be Outlined By:</p>

<p>C. Question method.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Five to ten definite questions on each
lesson.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

<p>D. Or, Topical method.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Topics assigned under each lesson
should be those which present special
phases of the general subject.</p></div>

<p>The two methods may sometimes be
satisfactorily combined.</p>

<p>Written papers, if included under either
question or topical form of study outline,
should be assigned only for subjects which
require some degree of original thought;
all information to be derived from textbooks
and encyclopedias should be covered
by the regular lesson for oral discussion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><b>Note</b>:&mdash;Number of meetings of study
clubs vary. Probably not less than sixteen
or more than twenty-six lessons. Many
average two meetings per month, October
to May.</p></div>

<p>Explanatory Notes on the Plan of Preparation
of Study Outlines</p>

<p>A. The use of a few designated books
(or a single book) as a basis for common
study of the same subject, or closely related
topics, provides the means by which
the unity and co-ordination is secured,
which is essential for effective and satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>Each member may, if she so desires, provide
herself at nominal cost, with the
source references necessary to cover the
essential points contained in the outline.</p>

<p>B. The books for collateral reading
should be carefully evaluated and selection
based upon their real value in supplementing
text, from the standpoint of reliability,
readableness and stimulative quality, also
that the price shall not be prohibitive of
purchase by clubs, local public libraries
and duplication by traveling libraries of
large number of copies for use in supplying
many different clubs.</p>

<p>Any local or traveling library may
easily provide additional books for collateral
reading whenever the collection
permits. It is not, however, deemed advisable
to have such extended lists incorporated
in the outlines; as a demand
would thus be created which could not
be supplied by the small library, and therefore
would become a handicap and embarrassment.</p>

<p>C. In outlining lessons by the Question
method the questions should be so formulated
as to stimulate discussion, not
simply to be answered in the affirmative or
negative.</p>

<p>The Question method permits a free expression
of individual opinions based on
personal reading. Such "discussion awakens
the keenest interest through the activity
of different minds upon the same
fact or idea," as each member is expected
to prepare herself to answer all questions.</p>

<p>The Question method is indorsed by
many educational experts as a desirable
method for the conduct of study classes,
and has been found to be practical and
satisfactory by many study clubs.</p>

<p>D. In outlining lessons by Topical method,
care should be taken to include no
more topics than can be thoroughly discussed,
and such phases of the subject assigned
as topics as will amplify the general
subject which has been studied in
common by all members from text upon
which the outline is based.</p>

<p>The reports were accepted, and it was
voted that the publication committee be
instructed to secure the preparation of
study outlines, as suggested in their report.</p>

<p>The Secretary then read her report on
the year's work, noting the publication
of the 1912 Yearbook of the League, and
the preparation by the President of an exhibit
for the meeting of the N. E. A.</p>

<h2>SPECIAL LIBRARIES ASSOCIATION</h2>


<h3>FIRST SESSION</h3>

<p>The first session of the Fifth annual
conference of the Special Libraries Association
was opened in the parlor of the
Hotel Kaaterskill, on Tuesday afternoon,
June 25, 1913, with the president in the
chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. A. W. Von Hohoff of New York,
opened the meeting with a paper entitled,
"Municipal reference work in New York
City." She spoke of the necessity out
of which this collection had grown and the
lack of ease with which information of this
character had been previously obtained.
In the short space of time during which
this new library has been established over
1,000 people have consulted it, mostly employees
of the city. It is serving especially
those employees who are studying for civil
service examination leading to advancement
in the city's work; newspaper men,
lawyers and real estate dealers have also
found it of value. A short resume of the
kind of literature on its shelves was given.
This library aims to keep New York City
in close touch with the activities and movements
of other cities.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The second paper on the program was
by Mr. N. C. Kingsbury, Vice-President of
the American Tel. &amp; Tel. Company, upon
"The library&mdash;A necessity of modern business."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Few people realize, who have had
any connection with the library movement,
that specialization has come to mean what
it has. Almost no one would have supposed
that even a large public service corporation
was maintaining five distinct library
collections, two at least of which are
in charge of trained librarians. This paper,
suggestive as it was of the increased activity
along library lines in the business
world, led to interesting questions.</p>

<p>It was followed by a paper by Mr. Andrew
L. Bostwick, municipal reference librarian
of St. Louis, entitled "Relations
between the municipal library and legislators."
He emphasized the necessity for
bridging the gap between the average librarian
and the average city assemblyman,
also the potency of personality which
should bring about a close and cordial relationship
between the library and its
readers. He spoke of the light manner
in which municipal libraries were often
created and the subsequent selection of the
librarian. The different kind of legislators
as existing in the average city were aptly
held before the audience in no unmistakable
terms; and finally, the choice of a
proper librarian with his necessary qualifications
was presented, together with the
manner in which the data accumulated</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>
<p>within the library should be put into the
hands of the legislator.</p>

<p>Dr. W. Dawson Johnston, librarian of
Columbia University, presented the next
paper entitled, "The relation between special
and general libraries."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> "The rise of
the special library is undoubtedly due to
the limitations of the general library. These
have been limitations of location as well
as limitations of service. A general library
can not in the nature of things be
everywhere and even when it is located
so as to serve excellently the needs of a
special institution, it can not render the
service of a collection selected for a specific
purpose. There must then be special
libraries for special institutions, societies,
clubs, and offices.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> For full report see "Special Libraries,"
1913.</p></div>

<p>"The special library, however, has its
limitations also. It is in danger of having
the disadvantages of a private library without
the advantages of a public library. This
is so true as to remind one of Charles
Lamb's description of pamphlets as books
which are no books. In similar manner
we are sometimes compelled to look upon
special libraries as libraries which are no
libraries at all, especially where they are
so small and so little used as not to require
the services of a librarian.</p>

<p>"There are too many special libraries
which are not to be distinguished from
general libraries except by their location,
too many that are simply inferior general
libraries, too many that may simply be
described as general libraries gone wrong."</p>

<p>He discussed the policy in the elimination
of books in each type of library, the
matter of the conditions of transfer from
a special library to a general one, the relations
between the two in respect to bibliographic
service, and in conclusion said:
"The special library forms an important
auxiliary to the general library and especially
to the university library, and more
important as subjects of research become
more practical in character. The general
library, because of its comprehensiveness
and size must in the nature of things be
more useful and must in the aggregate be
more used. But if a special library is well
selected, that is, if only the best and latest
books are admitted to its shelves, it must
be proportionately more used than the general
library and with better results. Some
time may be wasted in finding a special
library and in gaining admission to it, but
little is wasted in it, while in the general
library the time wasted in getting books
and in reading books which were better
left unread is simply appalling."</p>

<p>Following this very interesting discourse,
a paper entitled, "The library of the School
of Architecture at Harvard University&mdash;The
treatment of collections relating to
landscape architecture, including city planning,"
by Miss Theodora Kimball, librarian
of this library, was read by title in the
absence of the author.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Miss Helen R. Hosmer, of the General
Electric Company, Schenectady, N. Y., presented
the last paper of the afternoon,
entitled "The library of the research laboratory,
General Electric Company."</p>

<p>"Research expects rebuffs, expects to accept
a small advance instead of a revolution,
expects to make mistakes, and frequently
to fail, but intends to let no lesson
go unheeded, and to learn from every
stumble.</p>

<p>"Inasmuch as every special library comes
into very close contact with those it serves,
it is not strange the research library partakes
of the same nature that pervades
the research laboratory. It too is, in this
case particularly, a field for experiment.</p>

<p>"The object in view is of course to render
as readily available as possible all the
information contained in the library on
subjects of present or possible future interest
to the laboratory staff.</p>

<p>"The main sources of this information
are two: first, the scientific and technical
literature, consisting of books, periodicals,
pamphlets and special publications, clippings,
and abstracts from the technical literature,
compiled by the publication department
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>of the company, and second the reports
from the various laboratories of the
company."</p>

<p>The handling of the different classes of
material in this library is minutely described
and covers several unique features,
both in the kinds of material handled and
in the methods used. In concluding, she
said: "We are attempting to build up a system
requiring the minimum amount of
work for maintenance, sufficiently simple
to appeal to the most hurried research
mind, flexible enough to admit of continued
improvement without demolishment, and
yet adequate to the varied needs of practical
scientific investigation."</p>

<p>Mr. R. R. Bowker, of the Library
Journal, added some very interesting
thoughts along the general trend of the
meeting drawn from his many years of
experience in library and commercial
fields, which were much appreciated by all
those present.</p>


<h3>SECOND SESSION</h3>

<p>The second session of the Association
was called to order in the Ladies' Parlor
at 3 p. m., June 26th, by the president.</p>

<p>A few general introductory remarks were
made by the president regarding the purpose
of this session which hinged chiefly
about the question of handling clippings.</p>

<p>Honorable Robert Luce in a very carefully
prepared address then discussed,
under the title, "The clipping bureau and
the library," the internal working of the
clipping bureau which bears his name.
Probably few librarians have realized the
enormous volume of detail handled by the
large clipping bureau in the course of a
day's work. Mr. Luce in his paper has
carefully brought home that fact and urged
that many users of material from clipping
bureaus, and among them librarians, had
never learned how to correctly judge results
of clipping-bureau service. This judgment
should be used upon the mass result
rather than upon detail. An interesting
description of the method of caring for a
collection of 20,000 or more articles of his
own proved an important part of the paper.
A discussion of the "scrap book" and its
function in the library was also handled.
An earnest plea was made for co-operation
on the part of the librarians ordering material
from the clipping bureau. The employment
of the clipping bureau is a step
in the line of efficiency. "No man accustomed
to business methods can fail to be
struck with the waste therein due to the
employment of high-grade minds on low-grade
work. When some part of the working
time of a public servant possessing intellectual
acumen is put into manual labor
that can be as well performed by a youth
without special training, there is economic
loss. When your subordinates handle the
scissors and the paste-brush, you are paying
them for work that can more quickly
and much more cheaply be done in our cutting
rooms."</p>

<p>A significant question by Mr. Bowker
brought out the following facts: "After
the reader marks the newspaper it goes to
the cutter. There is very seldom any loss
there. Occasionally an item is slashed
or overlooked, and when the clippings have
been cut and pasted they go to the sorter,
whose duty it is to sort them by groups.
We have the clippings divided into 128
classifications. We allow each customer
one of those classifications." Mr. Luce answered
many other questions raised by
different speakers.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> See full discussion in "Special Libraries."</p></div>

<p>Following Mr. Luce's paper, Mr. Jesse
Cunningham, librarian of the School of
Mines and Metallurgy, Rolla, Missouri, reported
as the Chairman of the clipping
committee his investigation of the use and
methods of handling and filing newspaper
clippings. A very careful digest of a questionnaire
sent to over thirty selected libraries,
discussed the matters of obtaining
clippings by these various libraries, the
arrangement of the material for clipping,
the service rendered by the clipping bureaus,
classification and methods of filing,
as well as the indexing and eliminating of
dead material, closing the report with a
discussion of the use and value of clippings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
their disadvantages, the purchasing
of clippings on special subjects and the
several conclusions arrived at by the committee.
A most excellent report was rendered.
The committee was continued and
requested to extend its inquiries along the
lines indicated.</p>

<p>In the absence of Dr. J. Franklin Crowell
of the Wall Street Journal, his paper upon
the "Clipping methods of the Wall Street
Journal library" was read by title.</p>

<p>Mr. H. W. Wilson of Minneapolis, followed
with a paper entitled, "Problems of
printed indexes in special fields."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The need for printed indexes in special
fields has been made manifest by the thousands
of fugitive scraps of indexes that
libraries here and there spend their time
and energy in producing for temporary
use.</p>

<p>"First steps toward printed indexes are
both fragmentary and inadequate. It
seems to be time to take the next step
in the development of index-making, a step
which involves concentration of scattered
ideas&mdash;a step which should be successful
because it means comprehensiveness, thoroughness,
uniformity, economy and efficiency.</p>

<p>"The special fields of literature in which
printed indexes are most likely to succeed
are thought to be as follows, in about
the order mentioned: Industrial arts, agriculture,
education, social problems.</p>

<p>"It will scarcely be necessary to defend
here the alphabetical index as opposed
to the classified arrangement. While
a classified list of articles has its value
in informing specialists what has been
published in their respective fields in one
particular month, or year, it is almost useless
as a book of ready reference in a library&mdash;useless
even to the technically
trained, exasperating to the layman.</p>

<p>"In a classed list the responsibility for
finding an article rests with the searcher."</p></div>

<p>The great difficulty caused by unsatisfactory
nomenclature especially in rapid-growing
new technical fields, was dwelt
upon at some length. In conclusion, he
said, "At least one new field should be
opened up each year."</p>

<p>In the general discussion which followed,
the questions of paper for clipping mounts,
adhesives, and preservatives, were touched
upon.</p>


<h3>THIRD SESSION</h3>

<p>The third session of the Association was
held on Thursday evening, June 27, 1913,
opening with the president in the chair
and about thirty persons present.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel H. Ranck of Grand Rapids,
reported as Chairman of the municipal
yearbook committee.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>In the absence of Mr. H. H. B. Meyer,
his paper entitled, "The division of bibliography
of the Library of Congress as a
clearing house for bibliographical information,"
was read by Mr. Bruncken of the
same library.</p>

<p>"I am planning, in the interval before
the next meetings of the state legislature,
to prepare a list of the subjects which
have been investigated by the several state
libraries or state legislative reference bureaus."
This will enable the division of
bibliography to inform an inquiring librarian
what states have taken up any question
his own state legislature might be interested
in. Several fixed forms of cards
for doing this work in order to eliminate
extensive correspondence are shown.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Miss Marie F. Lindholm presented a
paper entitled "A review of the chief
sources of special library collections."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

Commission Library of New York, or the Secretary's
office.</p></div>

<p>While the author has been for some time
connected with a prominent public service
commission, the very careful and painstaking
enumeration of sources of material
can but prove of unusual value to almost
any special library in the country. Under
thirteen main headings the paper treated
of a general reference foundation, reference
sources of particular value to public
service commission or corporation libraries,
chief reference sources for a financial library,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>

<p>those for a municipal reference library,
current books and special reports,
periodicals, government and state reports,
society publications, company and trade
publications, legislation, legal decisions
and briefs, manuscripts, original records,
blueprints, maps, etc., and finally co-operation
in special library work. Should one
about to form a library of almost any character
have before him this paper he would
without serious effort gather about himself,
without other help, a splendid foundation
upon which to build his immediate specialty.
Much complementary discussion followed.</p>

<p>Following this the report of the Secretary-Treasurer
discussed the widening aspects
of the Association, the growth of its
membership, both in numbers and in distribution,
the financial condition of the society,
the large number of inquiries which
had been received by the secretary's office,
indicating the spread of the special library
idea, the methods for advertising the Association
and its activities which are of interest
to the members, the results obtained
in the past year through the Responsibility
Districts established at the beginning of
Mr. Handy's administration, the value and
possibilities of the employment exchange
operated through the secretary's office,
and the contemplated brochure advocated
by the Executive Board for placing before
interested parties the important facts, such
as the Association's growth, scope, purpose,
constitution, membership, committees,
printed literature available, etc.</p>

<p>After receiving the report of the Executive
Board and accepting the same in toto
and transacting such other business matters
as remained, electing new officers, etc.,
the meeting adjourned sine die.</p>

<h2>POST-CONFERENCE TRIP</h2>


<p>Saturday noon, June 28, the post conference
party left Hotel Kaaterskill with feelings
of mingled pleasure and regret. The
conference week with its happy reunion
of old friends was past, and the prospect
of a week of travel with its unknown possibilities
of sight seeing and impromptu library
conferences banished the depression
that follows the breaking up of a happy
party. Vexing details, as paying unusually
large hotel bills, arguing with the drivers
about double payment of bus fares and
exorbitant tipping of porters to insure
prompt delivery of trunks at the station,
were soon forgotten. For a week we were
to be care-free, shifting all responsibility
and planning to our genial conductors, Mr.
F. W. Faxon and Mr. C. H. Brown. Even
trunks were forgotten, not only by the
party, but by the railroad people until the
casual inquiry of one of the party brought
them to light and started them again on
their journey.</p>

<p>The rapid descent by the Otis Elevating
Railway with the accompanying ringing
sensations in the ears made us realize the
great height at which we had lived the
past week. We soon found ourselves in
the heavier, warmer air of the sea level
speeding towards Albany through the fertile
farms of the Hudson Valley. We caught
occasional glimpses of the Hudson, bearing
on its sluggish tide the graceful, white-sailed,
pleasure crafts and the clumsy, but
vitally freighted, canal barges.</p>

<p>Comfortable quarters in Albany were
found at the Hotel Ten Eyck, and the party
spent the evening at the new Education
Building visiting the new State library and
library school. The building is considered
one of the most beautiful in the world. It
is certainly very beautiful when considered
alone, but it is a pity that it could not
have had a larger site and more advantageous
setting. The general plan of the
building with its magnificent distances
gives a corridor appearance to all the library
rooms except the reference room,
which is superb in its general effect and
equipment. The lighting scheme of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
room, which is both direct and indirect,
is very effective. The absence of mural
decoration is a marked feature, and the
room in all its appointments is obviously
set apart for serious study and work.
The individual desks, which were planned
by the librarian, attract immediate attention,
as they are admirably arranged to
give good light, convenience, and privacy
to the student.</p>

<p>The new library school with its splendid
outfit was of great interest to former students
in the party who remembered the
cramped and migratory quarters in the old
school. Every feature that experience had
suggested and foresight could devise
seemed to be there to aid and inspire the
student. The older students noticed with
pleasure the portraits of Mr. Dewey and
Mrs. Fairchild which adorned the walls of
the main class room. Miss Woodworth
had prepared a temporary exhibition of
class photographs which aroused pleasing
memories. The interest was divided between
gratification at the growth in
strength of character and success of the
earlier classes and mirth at their costumes.
A permanent exhibition which is
the special pride of Miss Woodworth is the
collection of work by the school alumni.
This contains library reports, bulletins,
and lists prepared in whole or in part by
former students. There are also many
books along historical and literary lines,
photographs of libraries planned or remodeled
by library school graduates, and photographs
of the former students. This collection
was most interesting in its tangible
evidence of the success of the students.
Miss Woodworth wants to make this collection
as nearly complete as possible and
a credit to the school. All former students
are urged to send her a set of all
their work, either printed or typewritten,
and photographs of their libraries and of
themselves, both when they were students
and as they are now. All material sent to
the school before the fire was burned.</p>

<p>On the next day, Sunday, all departments
of the library were open to the visiting
librarians and all went a second time
to see by daylight the splendid rooms, so
admirably equipped and planned to give
quick and efficient service to the reader.
All left the library with a feeling of admiration
for the knowledge, skill, and executive
ability of those who had created
from nothing in less than two years one
of the great world libraries.</p>

<p>On Monday morning at an early hour we
were hurried to the train to secure seats
in the dining-car. Our English friend was
aghast at this American custom of "first
come, first served" so early in the morning,
and we had to admit that in this case
a previous booking of seats would have
been more comfortable. We had the unexpected
comfort, however, in this case,
of early breakfast in a stationary dining-car.
Our route that morning was through
the Mohawk Valley along the Erie Canal
with its placid mode of travel. Glimpses
of the foothills of the Adirondacks broke
up the monotony of the journey through
this level country and gave us hints of the
mountain scenery to come. The name
"Adirondacks" suggested the rough, mountain
wilderness and we were eager to
reach it. At Utica we turned north and
soon began to climb. The country became
wilder and occasional log houses suggested
pioneering. At Fulton Chain station
we left the main line of the Adirondack
division of the New York Central and in a
short time our special car, which was now
rather hot and dusty, was deserted at Old
Forge for the little steamer on the First
Lake of the Fulton Chain. We were in the
wilderness at last and enjoyed to the utmost
the few hours' ride through this chain
of beautiful lakes. Hills and mountains
were on all sides clothed with the forests
in all their glory of early summer greenery.
There were few signs of civilization
and we felt as remote from our daily tasks
of doing good to others as the most reprobate
could desire.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon we reached Eagle
Bay Hotel at the head of Fourth Lake, our
headquarters for several days. Our long
delayed dinner was most welcome, as glorious
air and scenery somehow fail to sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>isfy
all physical needs. That afternoon,
while exploring the shore of the lake, we
made our acquaintance with the Adirondack
open camp, or "lean-to", lined with
balsam boughs on which to sit or lie in the
evening and spin yarns while the campfire
blazes in front. We all wanted to try
the game and those who had cameras took
appropriate pictures. We must have come
at the wrong time of the year, however,
for, alas for the romance of an Adirondack
lodge, no one seemed to care to brave the
attacks of the mosquitos and flies which
filled the woods about sundown. All sought
the refuge of the hotel piazza enveloped
in a stifling smudge from burning green
hay or retired early to well screened bedrooms
to catch up on the lost sleep question.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning we started for Blue
Mountain Lake over the Raquette Lake
Railroad. Until within a few years this
country was an almost unbroken wilderness
and the road even now runs through
the heavy woods in a clearing so narrow
that the trees shade the train and the full
effect of the forest can be enjoyed. The
trip through Raquette Lake, the "queen of
the Adirondacks" which owes it name to
its very irregular outline, gave many opportunities
for those with cameras to get
fine pictures. From Raquette Lake there
was a short trip along Marion River winding
through a stretch of forest famed for
deer hunting. Then came a portage to
Utowana Lake of about a mile by a primitive
train of discarded Brooklyn open
horse-cars drawn by a diminutive locomotive
over a creaking railroad.</p>

<p>Our English friend was much interested
in the fauna of the Adirondacks and we
hoped at this point we could show him at
least one bear. Perhaps the Adirondack
bears like those in the Yellowstone are
shy early in the summer visitor season,
for we did not get a glimpse of one of
them. The only fauna we saw aside from
the birds were chipmunks, red squirrels,
one woodchuck, and two rabbits. In Eagle
Lake we passed the famous old eagle's
nest and some of the ladies were in raptures
over the herons which they thought
were eagles. We passed beavers' houses,
which we admired on faith, since no one
had ever seen beavers working on them.
On Blue Mountain Lake even the most self-contained
became enthusiastic over its
beauties. From its charm of outline, its
wooded and rocky islands, its purity and
loveliness, it well deserves its claim as the
pearl of all the wilderness waters. It
claims with Lake Placid to be the loveliest
lake in the eastern states. Across the
lake is Blue Mountain with its blue dome
rising to a height of 4,000 feet. Its forest
clad side slopes directly to the water's
edge inviting the mountain climbers to try
their mettle. We left the steamer here
and were carried by automobile about a
mile up one of the hills to the Blue Mountain
House where we had a glorious view
of the lake. It seemed a pity to waste time
on dinner, but we did and found it most
delectable. Although the thermometer
stood in the nineties, four of the men, our
English friend among them, climbed Blue
Mountain. The less strenuous rested and
enjoyed the view and the beauties of a
wonderful garden nearby in the woods.
The return trip to Eagle Bay made in the
cool of afternoon and evening was enjoyed
perhaps even more than the morning
trip.</p>

<p>We were beguiled on this excursion as
on others by frequent comparisons between
English and American customs and
scenery. This added much to our enjoyment
and knowledge because we could
look at things from two points of view.
One observation which struck us as novel
was that the English mountains were better
than the American because they were
usually treeless. Aside from the economic
axiom according to which this is a fault,
we considered this position untenable, as
we thought the barren, dead, English
mountains we had seen would be much
more beautiful if clothed with living
green. However, when we were told that
it was more enjoyable climbing English
mountains because there were no underbrush
and trees to impede one and shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
out the view and the breeze, we agreed it
all depended on the point of view and the
weather.</p>

<p>The next morning, Wednesday, after a
swim in the lake, some climbed Eagle
Mountain just back of the hotel. This was
an easy climb and from the "shelter" at
the top there was a fine view of the lake.
This beautiful lake region is still wild and
primitive, there are few pretentious camps
or hotels and it is not generally known.
More should visit this country to enjoy its
beauty before it becomes the resort of
wealth and fashion. At noon we left this
beautiful spot and, with many regrets,
parted with Mr. Brown, our efficient guide
to this region. We went on by train by
way of Carter and Saranac Inn Station to
the Lake Placid Club, our headquarters
for the next four days. A delay in train
connections at Saranac gave us a chance
to ride about this famous resort where
Stevenson once spent a winter in search
of health. One of the interesting sights
was an imitation Alaskan camp with log
huts and Esquimaux dogs for the use of
a moving picture making company, when
showing scenes in the wild northwest. The
imitation of the northwest was so good
that it took considerable mental effort to
realize we were still in the Empire State
with civilized life all about us.</p>

<p>So many good things had been planned
for us at Lake Placid, that we were often
at a loss what to choose. We usually tried
to do everything. The first evening Mr.
Dewey welcomed us and the other librarians,
who had gone directly to the Lake
Placid Club from the Catskills, with a good
supper in a special dining room where we
could all eat together. He then outlined
the plan of entertainment during our stay,
delegating his son, Godfrey, to carry out
details and attend to our comfort and
well-being. To these three, Mr. Melvil
Dewey, Miss Katharine L. Sharp, and Mr.
Godfrey Dewey, the party is most grateful
for the welcome they received and the
good time they enjoyed. The Lake Placid
holiday will be long remembered with delight
by those fortunate enough to enjoy
it.</p>

<p>The entertainment included automobile
tours on several days to the famous places
in the Adirondacks, covering a territory
that would take several weeks to explore
in the ordinary way. When we left Lake
Placid we felt we ought to suffer from a
case of Adirondack travel indigestion.</p>

<p>Thursday morning two parties were
ready to start at 6:30 in the Stanley steamers
driven by Mr. Godfrey Dewey and Mr.
Hubert Stevens for an all day trip of about
110 miles. It was a glorious day and the
early morning ride in the cool, bracing air
made us forget every care and worry. We
followed the West Branch of the Ausable
River, with the road crossing it many
times and often winding beside it on narrow
ledges with the mountains towering
above us where we could get the proper
thrills of danger. We all felt confidence
in our chauffeurs and enjoyed equally the
swift runs on the level state roads, the
racing up the steep mountain roads and
the swift plunges into the valleys. We
stopped for a moment at the beautiful Wilmington
High Falls and then sped on to
Ausable Chasm. We explored the Chasm
and made the trip by boat through the
gorge. This seemed a bit perilous and,
although assured there had never been
an accident, we took our places in the
boat with an uneasy feeling. The ride
on the swift, deep river in this wonderful
cleft in the mountain was, however,
all too short. We would have lingered to
enjoy the wonders and beauty of the gorge
festooned with vines and banked with
ferns which found a congenial home in its
limestone walls, but there was a long journey
ahead. We climbed the walls of the
Chasm to our waiting automobiles and
were soon speeding south, with Lake
Champlain on our left and the Bouquet
River for company along our road. Occasional
stops were made to take on water,
sometimes from the hose at a friendly
hotel, sometimes from a brook, and once
from the stock drinking-trough at a farm
house where the agitated farmer's wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
was fearful that our great machine was
going to pump the trough dry. At Westport
Inn we joined the other party, and
had a rest on the cool piazza and a good
dinner. In the afternoon we ran west
through Elizabethtown to the mountains
again, stopping for a moment to cheer our
friends in the other car who had punctured
a tire. Our turn to stop for repairs came
soon, when our friends extended their advice
and sympathetic aid and passed on.
In a few miles more we began to climb a
narrow mountain road which seemed impassable
in places, and were enjoying the
wild scenery when another tire puncture
held us up in a lonely place, remote from
the telephone. A family touring party in
another automobile stopped to offer aid,
but they could not help us. The women in
that party inquired if there were wild animals
thereabouts and, when assured that
there were lynxes, bears and other fearsome
beasts in the woods, they besought
their men folks to hasten on before the
dark should overtake them. For a number
of miles we crept along in a crippled condition
to St. Hubert's Inn, where we waited
several hours till a new tire could be
sent from home. The rest of the trip
was largely after dark over rough, narrow,
precipitous roads along the Cascade Lakes
where we had our fill of the spice of danger
of mountain night travel. We reached
home too late to attend the council fire at
Iroquois Lodge.</p>

<p>Friday, July Fourth, was celebrated by
the absence of fire-crackers and fireworks
and other nerve racking and dangerous
devices. Instead, a competitive prize fire
drill by the Club fire department was held.
Guests could thus see how secure against
harm from fire life and property are at
the Club. Under Miss Sharp's guidance,
a tour of the Club property was made in
the afternoon, and we saw how the comfort
and well-being of the guests were
cared for in the various departments, such
as the laundry and the kitchens. Informal
tea was served at Miss Sharp's cottage,
The Larches, where Mrs. Frederick M.
Crunden assisted Miss Sharp in dispensing
good cheer. That evening the party enjoyed
an informal banquet, with Mr. Dewey,
Miss Sharp, and other resident members
of the A. L. A. present. Just as the dinner
closed, the bonfire on the lake was
started and the beautiful and unusual spectacle
was enjoyed of viewing the fire
through a curtain of water from one of
the powerful fire hydrants.</p>

<p>On Saturday several short automobile
rides were taken in the morning, including
one to the home and grave of John Brown,
of Ossawatomie, now the property of the
State. In the afternoon the party was
taken by launch to Moose Island in Lake
Placid and had a picnic lunch before a
camp fire in a typical Adirondack shelter
fragrant with fir balsam boughs. On the
ride home mist and rain lent mystery to
the beauties of the lake, and just before
the trip ended double rainbows proclaimed
the end of the storm and a fair day for the
morrow. That night a delightful dinner
was given the party at Iroquois Lodge
which was graced by the presence of Mrs.
Dewey. A charming feature of the dinner
was the arrangement of lighting wholly by
candles in rustic candlesticks of white
birch, some of which were used to light
our way home through the woods, and
treasured afterwards as souvenirs. After
dinner the company assembled in the council
chamber and listened to a graphic story
by Mr. Dewey of the origin and growth
of the Lake Placid Club. Originally
planned to afford an inexpensive, sane,
healthful vacation for educational and literary
workers, including librarians, it had
surpassed all expectations in its success
and growth. Before the party broke up
the thanks and appreciation of all for the
good time enjoyed at Lake Placid as Mr.
Dewey's guests were voiced by Mr. Hill,
Mr. Thwaites, and Miss Ahern. Mr. Jast
brought a message of appreciation from
over seas where, he said, Dewey is a
household word in the library world. All
spoke in a reminiscent vein and expressed
the hope that Mr. Dewey might again take
active part in library work.</p>

<p>A small party climbed Whiteface that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
day and had a rather rough experience,
particularly on the descent owing to the
heavy rain.</p>

<p>On Sunday automobiles carried the party
through Saranac to beautiful Loon Lake,
one of the famous, old-time Adirondack resorts,
where we stopped for a few minutes,
and then went on to Paul Smith's on lower
St. Regis Lake, perhaps the oldest and
best known Adirondack hotel. Here, as at
the Westport Inn, we were guests of the
proprietor at a fine dinner. The hotel also
arranged a boat trip for us through the
Lower St. Regis, Spitfire, and Upper St.
Regis Lakes where we saw some of the finest
of the Adirondack camps. On our way
home we visited two famous sanitariums
for the cure of tuberculosis, the state institution
at Ray Brook and Trudeau's Sanitarium,
a private, endowed hospital. On
this trip no breakdowns marred the pleasure,
and, aside from a little delay in starting
owing to the agitation of a timid lady
from Chicago who found herself alone on
a rear seat with two mild men, all events
came off as scheduled. It might be noted
in passing that on all the automobile trips
there were at least two and sometimes
three men in each car, a marked advance
as compared with the famous White Mountain
coaching trip with one man to a
coach.</p>

<p>This day, which was perfect in its sunshine
and cool, bracing air, was the climax
of the trip. With keen regret we gathered
to bid good-bye to our hosts at Mrs.
Dewey's afternoon tea. This Post Conference
will long be remembered as one of
the best of them all.</p>

<p>The party broke up that night. A few
stayed on for a rest at Lake Placid and the
others took their ways homeward. Some
journeyed down Lake Champlain and Lake
George, and one stopped at Saratoga to
be lost in wonder at the huge hotels where
all the A. L. A. might easily be housed in
comfort and elegance should that body
ever meet there.</p>
